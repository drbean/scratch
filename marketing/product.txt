Uniqlo has to design clothes and see if customers like them. But, it also has to know what clothes will be popular in the next six months, in spring or fall, and produce those kind of clothes.

In the fashion industry, clothes are only fashionable for a short time. Uniqlo has to change the style of its clothes all the time.

New styles are developed for the spring and fall season. But when one style of clothes is becoming popular, small changes are continually made in the style to keep it popular.

If these continual small changes are not made, the style can quickly lose popularity.
