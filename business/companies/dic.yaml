  - Mark lives in IKEA--Moving in

    Mark: Today's the big day. IKEA is letting me move into their store for a week. First, I need to introduce myself to the people I'm going to live with for the next week--the great employees of IKEA. Now that I'm living here, it's kind of like they're working for me.
    ...
    So everyone I've met here at IKEA so far has been really friendly. The janitor Louis, is very knowledgeable and friendly. If you need any help, (To Louis) I'm happy to mop, or do whatever you want. Nice meeting you.
    Louis: Nice meeting you, too.
    Cashier: I think it's pretty weird. I mean to stay here for six days and, you know, six nights, or whatever. 

    Mark: Right now, we have forty-five minutes until the store opens, so we have to find the bedroom set of my dream. There are hundreds to choose from. But, this has to be the best bedroom set ever. Let's do it. 

    And then I found it. The perfect place for me to crash for the week. Wow! This is it.
    Cool, man. I can make cookies tonight. Wow. Bake pasta. This is awesome. All my cooking needs. A refrigerator. Wow! A bedroom set for the twins I don't have. This place has everything. An apartment like this in New York City would cost three thousand dollars a month.

    Let's see what they have in the wardrobe. Oh, this is cute. Let's see what they left for me. Oh, wow. Well, this is hot. I love that the hanger comes with it. You can't remove the hanger from the clothing. They're based out of Sweden. This must be the latest fashion. This is hot.

    IKEA even gave me some free stuff. The Swedish are the kings of hospitality.
    On behalf of IKEA, we'd like to present you with these gifts, welcoming you into the neighborhood.
    Mark: My gosh. Thank you so much. Um, Scott, I'm going to be here all week. So if you want to hang out, definitely stop by. We'll have a lot of fun. Just, next time you come up, knock. Okay.
    Scott: Okay. I will. Sorry about that.
    Mark: Don't worry about it.

    Cashier: This's a big building. Lot of places to get lost in.
    Voice-over: It's probably going to take me all week to explore the entire store, but I thought I'd take an after-dinner stroll to look around. But then disaster struck. I was lost in IKEA.
    Mark: Where am I?
    Voice-over: This is the twentieth time I've walked past the sheepskin rug.
    Mark: I can't get home. You have to physically take me to my home. You have to walk me. I'm helpless.
    Voice-over: Thankfully, a friendly IKEA employee returned me safely to my home.
    Mark: My bedroom set! Yo, man. Thank you. Are you okay? Thanks, bro'. I'll talk to you soon.
    Cashier: This's pretty weird.

    Mark's Voice: Testing. Testing. Attention, IKEA customers. The store is now closed. Please bring all purchases to check-out. Some people want to sleep here for crying out loud.
    Mark: This is Thor, the god of Swedish furniture. Please bring your purchases to the front immediately.
    Voice-over: Customers were leaving. Security was locking up. And I realized I could do whatever I wanted. 
    Mark: Yeh! Hi, honey. Oh, not much. It's pretty boring around here. I think I'm probably going to go to bed soon. Oooh. I think my cellphone is going, Ouch. Sssh.

    Look at me. I'm skateboarding past breakables. Caution. Do not enter. It's just a bunch of shopping carts.
    Kind of smells like urine.

    So we found this hidden corridor. No IKEA customers know about it. We're going to explore it. Follow me. Oh, my gosh. It's something I can't pronounce.

    We're here. It's the middle of the night. The only other person than me is Security Guard Jarvis. Thank you for being here.
    Jarvis: You're welcome.
    Mark: I'm going to be staying here in the middle of the night. Does it get scary?
    Jarvis: It does. It does get scary. After midnight, all the lights shut off. And then we start hearing squeaks and sounds and whistlings. If I was you, I would like to stay in the light. Care to go play ...
    Mark: In the balls?

    IKEA has a strong internationally known brand that is attractive to many consumers. The IKEA business model is unique with few direct competitors. Its innovative, but functional and cheap, products have been responsible for its success. Although specialist knowledge is not required in sales of many of its items, its sales staff does have specialist knowledge in kitchen installations and other areas where customers have to spend a lot of money.

    The company relies on European markets. Although it is trying to develop operations in Asia and Russia, ninety percent of its stores are in Europe. IKEA's business model is to focus on low prices, but this is also a weakness. It cannot target the middle and high ends of the market and cannot charge medium-level and high prices. Its after-sales service is also very simple. It can offer little help showing customers how to put the furniture together.

    The development of Asian and Eastern European operations is an opportunity to develop new markets. But it is also an opportunity to try selling more expensive products than the products it sells in Europe. IKEA can also use the Internet to do business. Now it sells its products in packages and customers put the products together themselves at home. Customers could order products on the Internet and the packages could be delivered to their homes.

    The economy is not good. People don't have money to buy furniture. People who do have money to buy furniture, are not spending it on furniture. They are saving money and not spending it on their homes. Shoppers who do go to IKEA are focusing on price and are buying less on sudden impulse. Other furniture stores, which are doing even worse than IKEA, are copying IKEA's designs and the way it sells products in flat packages. They are taking away IKEA customers.
