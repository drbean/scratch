    Interviewer: What are the factors that make IKEA such a highly successful company.
    Jelkeby: I think for IKEA it starts with a very simple, straightforward business idea that is easy to understand, easy to work with, both for customers, as well as co-workers, actually. Added to that, we have a strong culture in the company that links this together. I think that's one of the reasons for us being successful worldwide.

    We have designers who are not only good on designing good-looking products, they understand production.

    Jelkeby: They're working closely with our trading offices around the world; they're going into suppliers, developing with suppliers products in the production line. Then, from there on, it's about the packaging, how we transport; flat packages. how we bring it into the store, easy to put on the shelf; and then of course for the customer, easy to bring home.
    Interviewer: How do you stay ahead of the competition in your business?
    Jelkeby: That, again, is linked to understanding the market, the customer needs.

    Jelkeby: .. the trends about that, how people live; of course, also understanding how the competitors are acting, what is going on in the market, price developments, new ways of meeting the customer and being aware of the, the trends and how we tackle that. But I think by the end of the day, I think IKEA, we are not only about products, we are about offering solutions to people's needs and understand that actually we can be very smart and make it practical

    .. and not only, again, good looking furniture.

    I think, again, er, stay true to yourself; er, be aware of the market you enter into, but still build on your strengths. Don't complicate it, in that sense, but still find this combination of, er, we are IKEA in this case, and this is the local market. Where is the differences? What do we need to adjust and adopt? What do we need to understand? And then, er, have an offer that fits that.

    Mark: Today's the big day. IKEA is letting me move into their store for a week. First, I need to introduce myself to the people I'm going to live with for the next week--the great employees of IKEA. Now that I'm living here, it's kind of like they're working for me.
    ...
    So everyone I've met here at IKEA so far has been really friendly. The janitor Louis, is very knowledgeable and friendly. If you need any help, (To Louis) I'm happy to mop, or do whatever you want. Nice meeting you.
    Louis: Nice meeting you, too.
    Cashier: I think it's pretty weird. I mean to stay here for six days and, you know, six nights, or whatever. 

    Mark: Right now, we have forty-five minutes until the store opens, so we have to find the bedroom set of my dream. There are hundreds to choose from. But, this has to be the best bedroom set ever. Let's do it. 

    And then I found it. The perfect place for me to crash for the week. Wow! This is it.
    Cool, man. I can make cookies tonight. Wow. Bake pasta. This is awesome. All my cooking needs. A refrigerator. Wow! A bedroom set for the twins I don't have. This place has everything. An apartment like this in New York City would cost three thousand dollars a month.

    Let's see what they have in the wardrobe. Oh, this is cute. Let's see what they left for me. Oh, wow. Well, this is hot. I love that the hanger comes with it. You can't remove the hanger from the clothing. They're based out of Sweden. This must be the latest fashion. This is hot.

    IKEA even gave me some free stuff. The Swedish are the kings of hospitality.
    On behalf of IKEA, we'd like to present you with these gifts, welcoming you into the neighborhood.
    Mark: My gosh. Thank you so much. Um, Scott, I'm going to be here all week. So if you want to hang out, definitely stop by. We'll have a lot of fun. Just, next time you come up, knock. Okay.
    Scott: Okay. I will. Sorry about that.
    Mark: Don't worry about it.

    Cashier: This's a big building. Lot of places to get lost in.
    Voice-over: It's probably going to take me all week to explore the entire store, but I thought I'd take an after-dinner stroll to look around. But then disaster struck. I was lost in IKEA.
    Mark: Where am I?
    Voice-over: This is the twentieth time I've walked past the sheepskin rug.
    Mark: I can't get home. You have to physically take me to my home. You have to walk me. I'm helpless.
    Voice-over: Thankfully, a friendly IKEA employee returned me safely to my home.
    Mark: My bedroom set! Yo, man. Thank you. Are you okay? Thanks, bro'. I'll talk to you soon.
    Cashier: This's pretty weird.

    Mark's Voice: Testing. Testing. Attention, IKEA customers. The store is now closed. Please bring all purchases to check-out. Some people want to sleep here for crying out loud.
    Mark: This is Thor, the god of Swedish furniture. Please bring your purchases to the front immediately.
    Voice-over: Customers were leaving. Security was locking up. And I realized I could do whatever I wanted. 
    Mark: Yeh! Hi, honey. Oh, not much. It's pretty boring around here. I think I'm probably going to go to bed soon. Oooh. I think my cellphone is going, Ouch. Sssh.

    Look at me. I'm skateboarding past breakables. Caution. Do not enter. It's just a bunch of shopping carts.
    Kind of smells like urine.

    So we found this hidden corridor. No IKEA customers know about it. We're going to explore it. Follow me. Oh, my gosh. It's something I can't pronounce.

    We're here. It's the middle of the night. The only other person than me is Security Guard Jarvis. Thank you for being here.
    Jarvis: You're welcome.
    Mark: I'm going to be staying here in the middle of the night. Does it get scary?
    Jarvis: It does. It does get scary. After midnight, all the lights shut off. And then we start hearing squeaks and sounds and whistlings. If I was you, I would like to stay in the light. Care to go play ...
    Mark: In the balls?

    IKEA has a strong internationally known brand that is attractive to many consumers. The IKEA business model is unique with few direct competitors. Its innovative, but functional and cheap, products have been responsible for its success. Although specialist knowledge is not required in sales of many of its items, its sales staff does have specialist knowledge of kitchen installations and other expensive items where customers have to spend a lot of money.

    The company relies on European markets. Although it is trying to develop operations in Asia and Russia, ninety percent of its stores are in Europe. IKEA's business model is to focus on low prices, but this is also a weakness. It cannot target the middle and high ends of the market and cannot charge medium-level and high prices. Its after-sales service is also very simple. It can offer little help showing customers how to put the furniture together.

    The development of Asian and Eastern European operations is an opportunity to develop new markets. But it is also an opportunity to try selling more expensive products than the products it sells in Europe. IKEA can also use the Internet to do business. Now it sells its products in packages and customers put the products together themselves at home. Customers could order products on the Internet and the packages could be delivered to their homes.

    The economy is not good. People don't have money to buy furniture. People who do have money to buy furniture, are not spending it on furniture. They are saving money and not spending it on their homes. Shoppers who do go to IKEA are focusing on price and are buying less on sudden impulse. Other furniture stores, which are doing even worse than IKEA, are copying IKEA's designs and the way it sells products in flat packages. They are taking away IKEA customers.

    Dr Bean has decided to try to make money from the website his students use to do their homework. He wants many people to listen to soundfiles on the Internet and to fill in the missing words on a website. He think this is a good way to improve English listening ability. He thinks he could set up a company that develops websites and writes software to run dictation exercises on the Internet. But would his company be a success? He must think about that.

    Why would people would want to pay him money? On the Internet everything is free, so it is difficult to make money. But some companies, like Google, do make a lot of money from the Internet. He hopes he can do the same.

    He doesn't have any experience setting up or running a business and he doesn't have any friends who would want to join him in the business. He also doesn't have any money, and doesn't know how to borrow money. He doesn't want to borrow money.

    In Taiwan, many people would like to be able to speak English. Many parents want their children to learn English, so they can succeed in their careers. Many people however don't want to put a lot of effort into remembering many English words and studying a lot of English grammar.

   Other people who might want to pay are people who have an interesting soundfile which they don't understand. They might give the soundfile to Dr Bean and ask him to set up a website where they can study what is on the soundfile.

   Hi. I'm Hal Bonelli. I'm Managing Director of Flicker and I'd like to tell you something about my company. As you know, we are looking for new investment to help us expand our activities, and I'm very much hoping that some of you here today will see what an exciting opportunity this is for you to invest with us.

   So, first I'm going to give you some general information about the company. Then, I'll go on to explain how we plan to expand in the future. And finally, I'll add in some figures ...
  - Hal Bonelli

   ... so you know what you can expect to gain from your investment. Let me start with some background.
   
   Flicker is best known as a manufacturer of cigarette lighters. But as you know, not so many people in the US smoke cigarettes these days. Sales of cigarette lighters are down. Ten years ago, our sales of cigarette lighters totaled 160 million dollars. But today, our sales are only 120 million. Ten years ago, we employed twelve hundred people at our main factory in Ohio in the US.

  - |+
   Now, we employ only seven hundred fifty in that factory.

   However, we think we can still sell this product. And our strategy is to move into new markets in Europe, Russia and China. For example, we now have a factory in China where we market lighters for the Chinese market. At present our sales in China come to only eight million dollars. But this is a very big market and we expect our sales to increase rapidly.

   At the same time, we have decided to move into new industry sectors.

   We are using our experience and expertise in making lighters to develop new products with similar technology. For example, we are now developing a new kind of lighter which you can use to light a barbecue or a fire when camping. We plan to go still further and to sell other kinds of camping equipment. We even plan to sell such products as clothing and luggage in the future, which is something completely new for us.

   So, how do we plan to do all this? Let me give you a more detailed look at our plans ...
