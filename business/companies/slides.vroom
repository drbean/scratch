Zara SWOT

Zara's (http://www.zara.com ) competitors are
H&M (http://www.hm.com ),
Uniqlo (http://www.uniqlo.com ), and
GAP (http://www.gap.com )

Zara started as a fashion imitator, producing cheap copies
of thousands of very expensive fashions very quickly.
It can still put a new fashion in stores in 4-5 weeks.

Only 25% of its clothes are made outside Europe. 50%
of its clothes are made in Spain in company-owned factories.

Zara wants to succeed in Italy, which is a tough market.
Very fashionable clothes there are very cheap, and many
foreign companies have failed. But it may have a chance.
