      B: Its products are only in the stores for 4-5 weeks. After that, new fashions take their place. The average Zara shopper goes into a Zara store 17 times a year looking for new fashions. Zara's need for speed has prevented it making clothes in Asia.

      B: The company is making a lot less money now, because fewer and fewer people are smoking cigarettes. Ten years ago, it made \$160 million. Now sales are only \$120 million. Employees number only 750, down from 1200 ten years ago. However, sales in China are increasing.
      C: Its plans are to develop new products like barbecue lighters and camping goods, but there are only a few products which use the same kind of technology as cigarette lighters. Those products don't make a lot of money for Flicker or other companies.
      D: People don't have a high opinion of Flicker. It is hated by people who hate cigarette smoking. And smokers don't love Flicker either. Cigarettes are expensive, but lighters are cheap. Smokers always smoke the same brand of cigarette, but they will use any lighter.
