      B: On the Internet, everything is free, so it is difficult to make money. But some companies, like Google, do make a lot of money. To start a company, you also need money. Dr Bean doesn't have any money and he doesn't know how to borrow money. He doesn't have any experience of running a company.

Many people however, want to learn English, even though they don't want to study very hard. It is very difficult to learn English.
      D: Some people who might pay Dr Bean for his dictation websites are schools which want to make their students do listening activities. Others who might pay Dr Bean are people who have an interest in a particular soundfile. They might give the soundfile to Dr Bean and ask him to create a website.
