  - At the Penske-Wynn Maserati-Ferrari showroom in Las Vegas, people didn't want to buy the cars. they just wanted to look at them. The problem was that there were lots of these people.

  -  The idea is for the farmers to let the government grow citrus fruit on their land for four years, and the government gives the farmers some money each year.
