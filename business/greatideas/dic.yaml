  - Penske-Wynn's problem
  - business
  - A
  - At the Penske-Wynn Maserati-Ferrari showroom in Las Vegas, people didn't want to buy the cars. they just wanted to look at them. The problem was that there were lots of these people. Many Americans who aren't rich go to Las Vegas because they dream about winning lots of money. These people like to look at expensive cars.

  -  Penske-Wynn started charging a 10 dollar entrance fee. People who said they weren't going to buy a Ferrari or Maserati, and who just wanted to look at the cars had to pay this 10 dollars. Children with their parents didn't have to pay. Ferrari clothes were also sold.

  - About one-fifth of the visitors said they were thinking of buying a car, so didn't have to pay. But there were so many visitors, the showroom was getting almost 100,000 dollars a month in admission fees. In addition, it was selling twenty to thirty cars a month.

  - The experiment was very successful. But other car showrooms may not be able to copy Penske-Wynn's solution. Other showrooms are not in Las Vegas. They do not have many visitors, and are not showing expensive cars to people who dream of being rich.

  - Indian farming problem
  - business
  - A
  - Farmers in Punjab grow rice, but they don't make very much money. The Punjab government wants to help them make more money. Pepsi wants citrus fruit to make fruit drinks. The three decided to work together to grow citrus fruit. The idea is for the farmers to let the government grow citrus fruit on their land.

  -  The idea is for the farmers to let the government grow citrus fruit on their land for four years, and the government gives the farmers some money each year. After four years, half of the money from sale of the fruit goes to the farmers, and half to the government. Pepsi is already making drinks from the fruit.

  - Pepsi is already making drinks from the fruit produced by the trees planted by the government. The government is taking 50 percent and giving farmers the rest. Pepsi said it will continue to increase the amount of citrus fruit it buys. It also said it wants to export drinks made from the fruit to other countries.

  - The farmers are happy with the money. Pepsi is happy with its source of citrus fruit. The government is happy the area is being developed. The Punjab area may become the world's biggest citrus producer. But other areas may not be able to copy this solution. The area is more suited to growing citrus than other areas.

    All the space on his site was sold and he made one million dollars. A few advertisers on the site were well-known, like Yahoo. But most of the advertisers are not well-known and their services are not good. For example, dating services, Internet gambling and free download sites. The website was criticized because the services of the advertisers on it were not good.

  - Alex Tew on Internet

    Channing: Hey guys, Welcome to Dorm Room Tycoon. Today I have the pleasure of interviewing Alex Tew. How are you, Alex?
    Tew: Hi. How's it going.
    Channing: I'm great. I'm good. Thank you so much for coming on today. Thank you. And could you introduce yourself?
    Tew: My name's Alex Tew. And I've been doing various Internet projects over the last ten years. Since I was a teenager, with varying degrees of success. And currently reside in San Francisco. I work for Monkey Inferno, which is Michael and Xochi Birch's new incubator. And they were the founders of Bebo, which they sold to AOL.
    Channing: So, why, why, why did you decide to join Monkey Inferno, and not focus on launching more projects of your own?
    Tew: Yes. My previous company basically failed. So, you know ..
    Channing: Which one was that?
    Tew: That was Popjam.
    Channing: Okay.
    Tew: And that had various reincarnations. All of which didn't really go anywhere. And, um, so I just .. I thought, you know, I had, I had sort of been doing my own thing for like ten years, pretty much my entire teenage and adult life. And I'd thought it would be a good opportunity just to take a step back and work for someone else for a while. And, and, also move ideally to San Francisco, which I'd been thinking about doing for quite a while. And Michael Birch and Michael and Xochi, good friends of mine, we had a chat, and you know, the opportunity came up to move over and to join them and its, yes, it's really exciting opportunity to learn from those guys, who are very experienced and successful and pick up a little learning that I can, you know, I can, I can do without sort of being ultimately responsible for a while. But ultimately, yeh, I mean, I'll definitely be back in the game at some point.
    Channing: Ha, ha. Back in the game. Ha, ha.
    Tew: This isn't a permanent .. You know, I never actually sort of imagined myself working for anyone else. Um, ever since I was very young, I never thought I would do that, but um, working with Michael and Xochi is great. You know, they're very, very, very nice and smart people. So, yeh, if I was going to work for anyone, then it would be them.
    Channing: I was listening to an interview, and you made the comment that failure is feedback? And I also .. but what, what are the things that you've learned from launching your projects that have changed your thinking? What are the things that you will not do again?
    Tew: What are the things I will not do again? Well, there are loads. There's all sorts of mistakes I've made. And, yeh. There's probably just probably too many things to mention, but .. The only thing is not necessariy what wouldn't you do again. It's more kind of just keep going, right? I mean, The main thing is that you don't stop having a try, you know. Failure, the ultimate failure is really to stop trying. You've only failed when you stop. When you step out of the game permanently. So as long as you kind of keep learning and stay busy, then I think success is inevitable if you just keep going. and you're always open-minded and, sort of, be kind of, be a student the whole time. Because, you know, back in 2005-6, you know I had the success of the Million Dollar Homepage. And I don't think that was a particularly good teacher for me in terms of learning about business, or success, or anything. You know, I probably thought I was king of the world, because I'd done this thing, and in reality I was very, very naive. And I still am, but hopefully a little bit less so.
    Channing: Naive in what sense? In the business side?
    Tew: Yeh. Well I just, I just became a bit confident. I thought, you know, if I've done that, then, you know, give me a bit of time, and I'm going to do some even better things. Which I still believe to be true, but your expectations slightly different in terms of what that time scale is. I thought like within one year of doing that, I would be doing something ten, one hundred times bigger. And actually it takes a lot longer, you know. I saw a very interesting, or a very kind of cool graphic online, which is success is not this kind of straight arrow that goes from left, bottom left to top right. It's kind of bottom left to top right. But in between it's like backwards and forwards, and up and down. It's like spaghetti, you know. Um, and .. but the main thing is, yeh, again just to keep learning and to keep going. The overall thing is you've got to, got to enjoy what you do. I just enjoy creating little projects and hopefully big projects too, um, eventually.  Um, but, you know, it's fun to create stuff. And the Internet is this amazing, powerful new force in the world that just has so much opportunity on it to do cool things, and make a difference to the kind of overall quality of life, I guess.
    Channing: Do you think it's learning? Or do you think it's just about doing things? Because the way I .. My realization is that everything is so unique that what you've learned about something else doesn't really apply to what you're doing now. What are your thoughts on that? Is it, is it just a matter of time. Or do you need to accumulate all this knowledge and insight before you launch, you know?
    Tew: Well, I wouldn't .. Yeh, I mean, I think that learning .. learning and doing are the same things, right? By doing, you learn stuff. And they can be specific things, like specific knowledge about, you know, the latest and greatest technology, or whatever. But obviously that changes. But, there are fundamental things, I think, that you get better at. Um, you know, hopefully you get better at, kind of, working with other people, You get better at hiring people. You get better at judging if someone's going to be a good person to have on your team. You get, you get better, sort of, understanding of yourself. What you're good at, what you're not good at. You know, um .. where I was 21, I had less insight into what I was not good at. And that's very dangerous. Because that's where you're naive. So once you realize that you're not good at everything, you try and mitigate those, um, those things. And, you try and focus and enhance the things that you are good at. So, um, and part of that is, you know, finding people that you can work with, and, um, you know, becoming, sort of, having a good radar for good people, I guess. Um, so there are kind of .. I.. I  think those are more kind of life skills, you know that you pick up as you get older and as you gain experience. But the specifics of how to do projects, you know, they are also .. kind of important. But they may be more, uh, they change a little bit more frequently.
