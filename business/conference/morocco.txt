    The Long Beach Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco is a five-star hotel on the beach, so it is very nice, but there is not much to do in the area around the hotel. 
    
    It has a lot of nice facilities, like a large swimming pool and a sauna, and a very large tropical garden where you can sit and eat and drink. It also has shops and a good nightclub where you can have fun in the evening.

    But there is not much you can do when you go outside the hotel. The town is one hour away by car. (The airport is the same distance away.) 

    There are two large conference rooms which both hold seventy people, but there are no smaller seminar rooms for smaller groups. This will be a big problem, because the conference participants will split up into smaller special interest groups to discuss things that are important for them.

    The cost of the venue works out at 1,500 dollars per participant. This includes all meals and entertainment at the night club and other places.
