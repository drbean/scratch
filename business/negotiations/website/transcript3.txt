You, together with D, are negotiating for the designer, who sets up websites for online retailers. On the other hand, A and B are negotiating on behalf of Michelle, an online bookstore operator. They represent Michelle.
You want to take two months to get the website up and operating. Your reason it you have a lot of other work to do and you want to do a good job on Michelle's site, even though you realize she wants it up quickly.
You want to limit the amount of information on the website and the different links that the user can click. Michelle probably will want the site redesigned, and a simpler design will make redesigning easier. It will also be quicker to finish a simpler design.
You want to charge Michelle fifty dollars an hour. This seems a reasonable amount of money. It's the normal fee for the job.
You want to limit the size of the site. Rather than individual images of all the covers of all the books that the bookstore sells, you want to have bigger images of a few of the popular books. This will mean users don't have to wait so long to see the images.
You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them may not be negotiable. You may not be willing to compromise on them. D has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will A and B accept your position?
