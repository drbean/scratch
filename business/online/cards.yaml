            The Internet has had a big effect on retailing. Online prices are very cheap because retailers do not have to run stores. Websites that publish price comparisons make the market even more competitive.
            Some retailers tried charging different prices for goods on their websites and in their stores. But this is now hard to do. People want retailers to integrate their operations so they can buy online and pick up their purchases in stores.
      B: To be successful, the website must be easy to find and look good. It must have good images and lots of information about the things on sale. There needs to be clear information about prices and special offers. Information about delivery of the products is very important. Also the site must be fast and easy to navigate. It must be easy to find things on the site and it must be easy to order the goods and pay for them.

            Not everyone likes buying online. Some want to see the real thing, not a picture. Some think their money will be stolen. Other people like going shopping.
            Customers who also like to use websites are also different. And even the same customer is different on different days. Sometimes they will look at the website and then go into a store. Sometimes they will order online. 
      D: Argos is a big retailer with many stores all over the U.K. which also has an online operation. It tries to integrate its two different forms of retailing, because its experience is that sometimes a customer will buy online and at other times the same customer will check the website to find information and then go into a store to buy the item.

      identifier: IBM online retailer study
      A: IBM did a study of online retailers and asked, 1. whether customers were advocates or not, 2. what elements of the online experience were most important to advocates and others, and 3. how well the retailers did with their operations. It also tried to 4. describe advocates and understand how 5. retailers could gain more advocates.
      B: Advocacy is defined by three things: 1. Whether a customer will recommend the site to family and friends. 2. Whether a customer will purchase new products from the same retailer, if the retailer starts selling them. And 3. Whether the customer would stay with the retailer if a competitor opened a different site. People who aren't advocates are apathetic or antagonists.
      C: Having advocates is important, because they spend 33\% more of the money they have than others at the site. The amount they buy is also 30\% more than others buy. They are also spending more over time. IBM also asked customers what is important on the site and found advocates agreed with the others. D will tell you what they are.
      D: IBM asked customers 15 questions and found everyone agreed most important was whether it was easy to shop. Second was whether they could get help when they needed help from a person online. Third was whether it was pleasant and enjoyable to use the site. In other words, convenience, customer service, and store experience.
