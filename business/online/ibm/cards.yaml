identifier: IBM online retailer study
A: IBM did a study of online retailers and asked, 1. whether customers were advocates or not, 2. what elements of the online experience were most important to advocates and others, and 3. how well the retailers did with their operations. It also tried to 4. describe advocates and understand how 5. retailers could gain more advocates.
B: Advocacy is defined by three things: 1. Whether a customer will recommend the site to family and friends. 2. Whether a customer will purchase new products from the same retailer, if the retailer starts selling them. And 3. Whether the customer would stay with the retailer if a competitor opened a different site. People who aren't advocates are apathetic or antagonists.
C: Having advocates is important, because they spend 33\% more of the money they have than others at the site. The amount they buy is also 30\% more than others buy. They are also spending more over time. IBM also asked customers what is important on the site and found advocates agreed with the others. D will tell you what they are.
D: IBM asked customers 15 questions and found everyone agreed most important was whether it was easy to shop. Second was whether they could get help when they needed help from a person online. Third was whether it was pleasant and enjoyable to use the site. In other words, convenience, customer service, and store experience.
