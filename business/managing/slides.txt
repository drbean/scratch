## The unexamined life is not worth living--Socrates

What should be your aim living life, working?

To make money, OK.

But also, to examine your actions and thoughts

## Aim of course

To get you to think like the boss, or a top executive. 
Be in control of your actions in the workplace.

It is unlikely that you will be using English in your job.

So we won't be doing Telephone English.

## The company

A controlled community where we spend a large part of our lives.

Management/the bosses have the power
because of the Golden Rule

## The Golden Rule

Not, 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'

But, "He who has the gold makes the rules."

## Conflict in the company

In a company, it's the workers who do the work.

All the bosses do is stand around giving orders.

What would happen if there were no bosses, or
the communists took over?

Would the company collapse?

## Same question, applied to this class

Dr Bean is a manager.
The students are the workers.

If Dr Bean were to drop dead, could this class
continue without a teacher?

# The answer

## There is an answer

Theories X, Y and Z

Douglas McGregor 

Theory X

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR03d9gN1nw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR03d9gN1nw)

## Theory X and Theory Y

Theory X: 0:00-2:00

Theory Y: 3:40-4:40
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQp9zFHgimUodd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQp9zFHgimUodd)

## Theory X: Authoritarianism, Direction and Control

Subordinates need constant supervision because students/workers
don't like to work.

Decisions must be imposed from above without consultation.

## Theory Y: Consensus, Self-initiative and Empowerment

Supervisors delegate responsibility because students/workers
have a desire to do a good job, and have better access to
the information required to quickly cope with changing needs.

## Vocabulary

authoritarianism consensus consulting control delegating empowerment imposing intitiative manage managers obligation orders subordinates supervisors Theory X(x2),Y(x3)

## Theory X and theory Y

_____(1) and _____(2), of McGregor in the '60s are now famous. He wanted people to think about the way _____(3) choose to _____(4). They have a choice between _____(5) or _____(6), between _____(10) their requirements with _____(11), or _____(7) with their _____(8) and _____(9) responsibility. The choice is between top-down _____(12), or bottom-up _____(13), and  depends on whether they think workers/students will take the _____(14) and feel an _____(15) to do their best or not. McGregor didn't believe _____(16) should follow _____(17) or _____(18). He didn't say _____(19) was a better style.

## Which theory does Dr Bean believe

- The first speaker (the odd numbered group's speaker) will argue Dr Bean believes Theory X, giving evidence from his teaching.
- The second speaker (the even numbered group's speaker) will argue Dr Bean believes Theory Y, giving evidence from his teaching.

* The group will decide which speaker presented the better argument.
* 2 spokespersons (not the speakers) will stand up and report to the class the discussion and the result.

## What kind of person are you?

Do you need to be told what to do?

## Are you a manager, Jack?

Are your subordinates able to work without constant supervision?

## Richard Branson

What makes you think he believes in Theory X or Theory Y?
