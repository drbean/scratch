You are a member of the Peterson sales team which has been joined with the Muller sales team in a new company, MPM. The other team was very different. There is going to be a meeting to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively.
Relationships: Your team is interested in working as a team, not how much money you make. They think the company's main aim is to keep the customer happy. Then it will make a profit.
Delivery dates: They believe the company should always meet its delivery dates. So they don't promise early delivery dates.
Reports: They always send in good, informative sales reports before the deadline. And they always send follow-ups when customers place an order.
Payment system: They would like a higher basic salary and bonuses if they exceed the monthly target.
Sharing information: They believe staff should share information about customers to maximize sales.
Customer loyalty: They do not put pressure on the customers to buy. They do not give expensive gifts to customers. They build loyalty by gaining their trust.
