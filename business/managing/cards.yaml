    identifier: recognition of ideas
    A: You talk to your husband, Nick about a problem at work. The company CEO, Brian uses some of your good ideas, but he never tells people that they are your ideas. You think that it's not fair for men to get recognition, but you don't get recognition.
    B: You get an email from a man called Nick, about his wife's problem with her company. You email Brian, the company's CEO. You think Debbie should talk to Brian about ways of working better together. She should ask Brian to help her by recognizing her ideas.
    C: You are CEO of the company where Debbie is a manager. You tell Nigel that Debbie's ideas belong to the company, because she is an employee. You say that she cannot sell her ideas to other companies. Recognizing her ideas would encourage her to sell them to other companies.
    D: Your wife Debbie tells you she wants to quit her job. She has a good job as a manager. But she is mad because the company sometimes ignores her good ideas and sometimes uses them without telling people they are her ideas. You email Nigel, asking for advice.
