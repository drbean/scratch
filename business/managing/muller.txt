You are a member of the Muller sales team which has been joined with the Peterson sales team in a new company, MPM. The other team was very different. There is going to be a meeting to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively. The meeting will be run by the Sales Manager (A) and the Deputy Sales Manager (B).
Relationships: Your team is mainly interested in how much money they can make. They think the company's main aim is to maximize profit.
Delivery dates: They promise early delivery dates, but the companies often cannot meet the dates, and customers complain.
Reports: They often send in short sales reports which are late and incomplete. And they often forget to send follow-ups when customers place an order.
Payment system: They are happy with the present system of low basic salary and high commission.
Sharing information: They are competitive and keep information to themselves, rather than sharing it with co-workers.
Customer loyalty: They are aggressive sales people and put pressure on the customers to buy. They often give expensive gifts to customers to buy their loyalty.
