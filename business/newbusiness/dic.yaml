    00:34 Interviewer: Anthony, when starting up a new business, how do you work out how much money you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: That's a very good question. Initially you need to look at the start up costs, as distinct to the running costs.  Because obviously when a business is first formed, there are a number of costs to get the thing going. For example, are you going to work from home? Are you going to have business premises? Do you need equipment? Have you got to buy stock? And all of these issues are very important before you even get going.

    There are hidden costs of course, which sometimes people forget when they're starting running a business. For example legal expenses, if you're setting up, if you need a trade name or a business name, there can be a lot of legal costs.

    There may need to be sign painting for your premises, for your vehicle.

    02:55 Interviewer: Ok, so we've worked out how much money we're going to need, how do you now go about preparing a business plan?

    Taylor-Rose: Well there's a very good saying that I often use, "that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail".  It's absolutely vital in my mind that you have to write something down.  Do it in clear, straightforward language. Have a general background details to the business: what you're trying to achieve. Make clear when you've found the business, highlight any achievements you've already had, which are important because that demonstrates experience and knowledge.

    A secondary part, but equally important part, of the business plan, is the financial aspect. These will include your monthly profit and loss forecast and your cashflow forecast. Both of these are vital. Cash is the key one: you need to get control of your cash. Cash is key. Without having the cash in your business it will not succeed.

    05:30 Interviewer: Then how do you work out how much you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: Well this basically is going back to the business plan and the financial aspects of the business plan. If you're in a position to borrow, consider getting more than you need.

    And that might sound a funny comment, coming from a banker, but it's always important that you've got enough finance. There's nothing worse than going down your business plan and three months in thinking 'Gosh, I'm running short of cash, where am I going?' You need all your energies to focus on running that business.

    So really make sure you've covered all those hidden costs and running costs that we spoke about in an earlier question. And make sure that you've borrowed enough to cover you for a margin and a buffer for unforeseen circumstances.

    Interviewer: Ok Anthony, but what specific areas of business would this finance be needed for?

    07:00 Interviewer: So we've thought about how much money we're going to need to start this business up. We've thought about a business plan. We've thought about finance and how much we need to raise. It's time to go to the bank. What should we actually physically take with us and how should we conduct ourselves in that meeting?

    Taylor-Rose: Well at the very least, of course, you need the business plan that we've spoken about before. That is essential because that describes your vision. That describes what you want to achieve.  That will list what you have achieved in terms of experience. So at the very least you do need your business plan with you.

    Be confident. You've probably thought about this idea for a long, long time, so be confident, but not over confident. Make sure that you present a warm picture of what you're looking to achieve. Be positive in it, but not over positive.

    Seelig: It is my pleasure today to, uh, introduce our fabulous guests. We have the founding team of Cooliris here. And I want to introduce, starting on my left, Sujanya Bhumkar, who is a, the CEO of the company. He has started several high-tech companies before. And the most notable of which was, uh, how can you, what can you ..
    Bhumkar: Vazu and Tamarind was, I would say, were pretty successful.
    Seelig: Okay. right. So he started several companies. I'm sure we'll hear something about that.

    We have Austin Shoemaker, who graduated from Stanford in 2005. And, uh,you're not going to believe it, look at him. He doesn't look that old. He also spent seven years at Apple. I think he was the youngest intern who was ever there, starting when he was fifteen. And in fact, I think he sold his first company when he was thirteen years old. What's that?

    Seelig: I think he sold his first company when he was thirteen years old. What's that?
    Shoemaker: There were other people involved.
    Seelig: There were other people involved? It wasn't just you? Okay, we'll give you all the credit. It's pretty impressive, anyway. And then, we've got Josh Schwarzapel, who also was a Mayfield Fellow, so I got to know him quite well over the last few years. And he is also on the founding team. And graduated from Stanford a year and a half ago. And was on the Stanford men's volleyball team.

    So we'll hear all about this. And let's get started. 

    I have one confession to make. I am a huge fan of Cooliris. I am such a fan of Cooliris that whenever I go to a web site that is not Cooliris enabled, I get very upset. And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me cool evangelist cards ..

    Seelig: And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me cool evangelist cards that I give out to everybody. So, uh, that's a little, uh, full disclosure at the beginning.

    So, um, you guys, this is kind of an interesting founding team. How did you guys all get to know each other? So, Sujanya, maybe you could tell us how this all ...

    Bhumkar: Sure, yeh. Actually, the company was started back in Jan of 06. And this came up with an idea. I had a friend of mine who called. It was a very simple idea, saying if you mouse over a link, then you can see a page, like a .. And Josh and I had actually met at the previous start-up. Josh used to come on several of the studies and had given us some advice and feedback. And he and I stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry, and wanted to conquer the world.

    Bhumkar: had given us some advice and feedback. And he and I stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry, and wanted to conquer the world. And very well-connected. So Josh and I, we were chatting about this, what we could do, potentially, And Josh says, I know a genius who has attended a class with me. And that genius is Austin. I says, why don't we all figure out and .. So we started out with a very simple thing. And I fairly believe, it's much easier to just to sort of jump in. As long as there's a basic boundary. That's where we have, what we knew. And we got started and very soon Josh was instrumental in getting us Gion, who helped us on some things, and XXXX, another champion student who was doing his PhD back then. And that's how the team was formed.
    Seelig: Right. Well.

    Seelig: It is my extreme pleasure to introduce our guest today. We have Jensen Huang, who is a co-founder of NVIDIA. And I want to tell you, eighteen years ago he was sitting in your seat. He was an MS student, master's student here at Electrical Engineering and two years after he graduated he founded the company. And he has been the president, CEO and member of the board of directors since its inception.

    One of the most wonderful things about having him here today is our kick-off Spring Quarter is he is also the incredibly generous donor to the School of Engineering. The new building that you see going up just outside is going to be named the Huang Building. And he gave thirty million dollars to name that building. So, hopefully, eighteen years from now, you guys'll be doing the same.

    So, ah. Without further ado, Jensen Huang. Thank you.

    Thank you, Tina. I gave my last, last pennies to Jim Plummer to build that building. Now, I am officially broke. So, um, instead of giving you a company presentation today, what I thought I would do is just have a conversation with you. You know, at any time, if you have a question, if you would like to change the direction of our conversation, just raise your hand and we'll talk about whatever comes up.

    Um, a lot of people talk about and write about building companies. And I can tell you first hand, that building a company is extraordinarily gratifying. It is also incredibly hard. And so the things that, that, um, uh, that you want to talk about, uh, with respect to the company-building process, is rather expansive. You could talk about company building processes from a lot of different perspectives. So I'm going to try and touch on a few of them that I think are particularly important in my experience.

    So sixteen years ago, NVIDIA had three people, three engineers. I was one of them. And, um, we had a perspective. Am I still on? Did I do something? Was that me? We had a perspective that, um, that, uh, hey, hey,

    You know I was just talking to those two. I went in the back to talk to the two guys and I asked them, So this is where command center is. They go, Yep. And I so, Do you guys get paid for this? And they said, Nope. Now I understand why.
    
    You think it's me? How about if I just did that? See, it's .. You can't beat.. You can't control user stupidity, you know? You're good. You're good. It was probably me. I was sitting on it.
    
    All right. So, so, um, sixteen years ago, uh, we started NVIDIA. And, um, uh, the insight that we had. Some people call it vision. Um, vision is an awfully big word to me.

    Vision's an awfully big word to me, because I believe, first of all, vision matters. Let me tell you that. Vision matters.  And I hope you understand that in a second. Um, but I like to use the word, perspective, because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. When you say vision, it feels like only a few selected visionaries of the world can have one. but everyone has a perspective. And that's in fact all vision means. That you see the world in a way that is either, uh, different, um, or otherwise, okay, than, than somebody else. Uh, and you see opportunities that I think are. that you believe are particularly important to go and address. That you can address in a particular way. 

    And so perspective, um, our perspective at the time, this is 1993. You guys won't remember this, but, uh, the PC, um was Windows 3.1.

    5:45 And the PC was becoming used for desktop or office animation. 

    Our perspective was that this particular device was unique in the sense that it has the ability to run programs. And what if we give it the benefit of running 3-D graphics programs, so that you could explore new worlds, games, you know, play games.

    And so, we started a company and the business plan, basically, read something like this: We're going to take technology that was available only in the most expensive workstations. We're going to try to make it, reinvent the technology and make it inexpensive.

    6:33 And the killer app was video games.

    And so I took this idea to Sand Hill Road, and they told me there was no video game market. People don't start companies to play games. And my parents, my mom, I remember calling my mom and telling her I'm going to start this company and she says, you know, What do you guys do, and I said, We build these things called 3-D graphics, chips, and people will use them to play games. And she said, Why don't you go get a job? And so, I umm...

    7:08 Now, of course, of course games was, we believe, going to be a very large part of the marketplace. Now we had that perspective for very obvious reasons. We grew up in the video game generation. I was the video game generation. I was the beginning of the video game generation. And so the entertainment value of video games, computer games was very obvious to me. And I could imagine how it could be a very large market, and a very large industry. For a lot of the people that were older, that sensibility didn't exist. And so, notice ...

    7:43 I've just described to you a perspective about the world that we had that is apparently, obviously, now true, because video games is the world's largest digital media industry today. It is apparently true. And yet at the time, our common sense was unique. Nobody would have created the technology, nobody would have created the company with the sole purpose of building technology to make video games possible. And so that was our perspective. Now we felt that that video games would, would of course fuel the technology development but you could use this technology for a whole bunch of other reasons.

    CD-ROM was about to be introduced. There were no PCs with networks. Um, wireless technology was . If you said, if somebody said, Radio. I think you would .. the word that would come to mind is FM radio. Uh, and so wireless technology didn't exist.
    The fastest microprocessor in the world was a 66 mHz
    
    And, one of my favorite applications ... this happened about, I guess about five years ago ... a small company, a struggling company here in Silicon Valley, called Keyhole. And they were , they created a 3-D virtual world. And it had no application. This 3-D virtual world, when you start out in space, you see the Earth, you zoom into any location you want, just by typing in the address, I thought it was such a fabulous way of exploring the world, going to places you've never been. And they couldn't raise a penny. And so, we er, we er, I was so excited about the company we put money into the company. And I went everywhere and showed that demonstration. I would tell people that this is the way we're going to do search someday. You want to search for something, and look for an address, You would type it in and we'd fly you there. Okay? And satellite images will continue to download and before you know it, you're right there on the street. And You might even see some buildings. That small company was eventually purchased by Google, and became Google Earth. Google Earth is now the single largest most downloaded frequently downloaded application in the history of mankind. Over 200 plus million downloads. So 3-D graphics could be used for a lot more than video games.
