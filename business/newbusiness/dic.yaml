    00:34 Interviewer: Anthony, when starting up a new business, how do you work out how much money you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: That's a very good question. Initially you need to look at the start up costs, as distinct to the running costs.  Because obviously when a business is first formed, there are a number of costs to get the thing going. For example, are you going to work from home? Are you going to have business premises? Do you need equipment? Have you got to buy stock? And all of these issues are very important before you even get going.

    There are hidden costs of course, which sometimes people forget when they're starting running a business. For example legal expenses, if you're setting up, if you need a trade name or a business name, there can be a lot of legal costs.

    There may need to be sign painting for your premises, for your vehicle.

    02:55 Interviewer: Ok, so we've worked out how much money we're going to need, how do you now go about preparing a business plan?

    Taylor-Rose: Well there's a very good saying that I often use, "that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail".  It's absolutely vital in my mind that you have to write something down.  Do it in clear, straightforward language. Have a general background details to the business: what you're trying to achieve. Make clear when you've found the business, highlight any achievements you've already had, which are important because that demonstrates experience and knowledge.

    A secondary part, but equally important part, of the business plan, is the financial aspect. These will include your monthly profit and loss forecast and your cashflow forecast. Both of these are vital. Cash is the key one: you need to get control of your cash. Cash is key. Without having the cash in your business it will not succeed.

    05:30 Interviewer: Then how do you work out how much you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: Well this basically is going back to the business plan and the financial aspects of the business plan. If you're in a position to borrow, consider getting more than you need.

    And that might sound a funny comment, coming from a banker, but it's always important that you've got enough finance. There's nothing worse than going down your business plan and three months in thinking 'Gosh, I'm running short of cash, where am I going?' You need all your energies to focus on running that business.

    So really make sure you've covered all those hidden costs and running costs that we spoke about in an earlier question. And make sure that you've borrowed enough to cover you for a margin and a buffer for unforeseen circumstances.

    Interviewer: Ok Anthony, but what specific areas of business would this finance be needed for?

    07:00 Interviewer: So we've thought about how much money we're going to need to start this business up. We've thought about a business plan. We've thought about finance and how much we need to raise. It's time to go to the bank. What should we actually physically take with us and how should we conduct ourselves in that meeting?

    Taylor-Rose: Well at the very least, of course, you need the business plan that we've spoken about before. That is essential because that describes your vision. That describes what you want to achieve.  That will list what you have achieved in terms of experience. So at the very least you do need your business plan with you.

    Be confident. You've probably thought about this idea for a long, long time, so be confident, but not over confident. Make sure that you present a warm picture of what you're looking to achieve. Be positive in it, but not over positive.

    Seelig: It is my pleasure today to, uh, introduce our fabulous guests. We have the founding team of Cooliris here. And I want to introduce, starting on my left, Sujanya Bhumkar, who is a, the CEO of the company. He has started several high-tech companies before. And the most notable of which was, uh, how can you, what can you ..
    Bhumkar: Vazu and Tamarind was, I would say, were pretty successful.
    Seelig: Okay. right. So he started several companies. I'm sure we'll hear something about that.

    We have Austin Shoemaker, who graduated from Stanford in 2005. And, uh,you're not going to believe it, look at him. He doesn't look that old. He also spent seven years at Apple. I think he was the youngest intern who was ever there, starting when he was fifteen. And in fact, I think he sold his first company when he was thirteen years old. What's that?

    Shoemaker: There were other people involved.
    Seelig: There were other people involved? It wasn't just you? Okay, we'll give you all the credit. It's pretty impressive, anyway. And then, we've got Josh Schwarzapel, who also was a Mayfield Fellow, so I got to know him quite well over the last few years. And he is also on the founding team. And graduated from Stanford a year and a half ago. And was on the Stanford men's volleyball team.

    So we'll hear all about this. And let's get started. 

    I have one confession to make. I am a huge fan of Cooliris. I am such a fan of Cooliris that whenever I go to a web site that is not Cooliris enabled, I get very upset. And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me cool evangelist cards ..

    So, um, you guys, this is kind of an interesting founding team. How did you guys all get to know each other? So, Sujanya, maybe you could tell us how this all ...

    Bhumkar: Sure, yeh. Actually, the company was started back in Jan of 06. And this came up with an idea. I had a friend of mine who called. It was a very simple idea, saying if you mouse over a link, then you can see a page, like a .. And Josh and I had actually met at the previous start-up. Josh used to come on several of the studies and had given us some advice and feedback. And he and I stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry, and wanted to conquer the world.

So Josh and I, we were chatting about this, what we could do, potentially, And Josh says, I know a genius who has attended a class with me. And that genius is Austin. I says, why don't we all figure out and .. So we started out with a very simple thing. And I fairly believe, it's much easier to just to sort of jump in. As long as there's a basic boundary. That's where we have, what we knew. And we got started and very soon Josh was instrumental in getting us Gion, who helped us on some things, and XXXX, another champion student who was doing his PhD back then. And that's how the team was formed.
    Seelig: Right. Well.

    Seelig: 2:53 It is my extreme pleasure to introduce our guest today. We have Jensen Huang, who is a co-founder of NVIDIA. And I want to tell you, eighteen years ago he was sitting in your seat. He was an MS student, master's student here at Electrical Engineering and two years after he graduated he founded the company. And he has been the president, CEO and member of the board of directors since its inception.

    One of the most wonderful things about having him here today is our kick-off of Spring Quarter is he is also the incredibly generous donor to the School of Engineering. The new building that you see going up just outside is going to be named the Huang Building. And he gave thirty million dollars to name that building. So, hopefully, eighteen years from now, you guys'll be doing the same.

    So, ah. Without further ado, Jensen Huang. Thank you.

    Huang: Thank you, Tina. I gave my last, last pennies to Jim Plummer to build that building. Now, I am officially broke. So, um, instead of giving you a company presentation today, what I thought I would do is just have a conversation with you. You know, at any time, if you have a question, if you would like to change the direction of our conversation, just raise your hand and we'll talk about whatever comes up.

    Um, a lot of people talk about and write about building companies. And I can tell you first hand, that building a company is extraordinarily gratifying. It is also incredibly hard. And so the things that, that, um, uh, that you want to talk about, uh, with respect to the company-building process, is rather expansive. You could talk about company building processes from a lot of different perspectives. So I'm going to try and touch on a few of them that I think are particularly important in my experience.

    So sixteen years ago, NVIDIA had three people, three engineers. [inaudible] 

    5:50 You can't control user stupidity, you know? You're good. You're good. It was probably me. I was sitting on it.
    
    All right. So, so, um, sixteen years ago, uh, we started NVIDIA. And, um, uh, the insight that we had. Some people call it vision. Um, vision is an awfully big word to me.

    Vision's an awfully big word to me, because I believe, first of all, vision matters. Let me tell you that. Vision matters.  And I hope you understand that in a second. Um, but I like to use the word, perspective, because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. When you say vision, it feels like only a few selected visionaries of the world can have one. but everyone has a perspective. And that's in fact all vision means. That you see the world in a way that is either, uh, different, um, or otherwise, okay, than, than somebody else. Uh, and you see opportunities that I think are. that you believe are particularly important to go and address. That you can address in a particular way. 

    And so perspective, um, our perspective at the time, this is 1993. You guys won't remember this, but, uh, the PC, um was Windows 3.1. [cut]

    7:52 And the PC was becoming used for desktop or office animation. 

    Our perspective was that this particular device was going to be unique in the sense that it has the ability to run programs. And what if we gave it the benefit of running 3-D graphics programs, so that you could explore new worlds, play games, you know, play games.

    And so, we started a company and the business plan, basically, read something like this: We're going to take technology that was available only in the most expensive workstations. We're going to try to make it, reinvent the technology and make it inexpensive.

    And the killer app was video games.

    And so I took this idea to Sand Hill Road, and they told me there was no video game market. People don't start companies to play games. And my parents, I remember calling my mom and telling her I'm going to start this company and she says, you know, What do you guys do, and I said, We build these things called 3-D graphics, chips, and people will use them to play games. And she said, Why don't you go get a job? And so, I umm...

    Now, of course, of course games was, we believe, going to be a very large part of the marketplace. Now we had that perspective for very obvious reasons. We grew up in the video game generation. I was the video game generation. I was the beginning of the video game generation. And so the entertainment value of video games, computer games was very obvious to me. And I could imagine how it could be a very large market, and a very large industry. For a lot of the people that were older, that sensibility didn't exist. And so, notice ...

    I've just described to you a perspective about the world that we had that is apparently, obviously, now true, because video games is the world's largest digital media industry today. It is apparently true. And yet at the time, our common sense was unique. Nobody would have created the technology, nobody would have created the company with the sole purpose of building technology to make video games possible. And so that was our perspective. Now we felt that that video games would, would of course fuel the technology development but you could use this technology for a whole bunch of other reasons.

    CD-ROM was about to be introduced. There were no PCs with networks. Um, wireless technology was . If you said, if somebody said, Radio. I think you would .. the word that would come to mind is FM radio. Uh, and so wireless technology didn't exist.
    The fastest microprocessor in the world was a 66 mHz
    
    And, one of my favorite applications ... this happened about, I guess about five years ago ... a small company, a struggling company here in Silicon Valley, called Keyhole. And they were , they created a 3-D virtual world. And it had no application. This 3-D virtual world, when you start out in space, you see the Earth, you zoom into any location you want, just by typing in the address, I thought it was such a fabulous way of exploring the world, going to places you've never been. And they couldn't raise a penny. And so, we er, we er, I was so excited about the company we put money into the company. And I went everywhere and showed that demonstration. I would tell people that this is the way we're going to do search someday. You want to search for something, and look for an address, You would type it in and we'd fly you there. Okay? And satellite images will continue to download and before you know it, you're right there on the street. And You might even see some buildings. That small company was eventually purchased by Google, and became Google Earth. Google Earth is now the single largest most downloaded frequently downloaded application in the history of mankind. Over 200 plus million downloads. So 3-D graphics could be used for a lot more than video games.

    14:10 Huang: And so that in a nutshell is TSMC. Unbelievable body of work. And unbelievable impact on the world. So tonight, Morris, I thought what we could do is we would talk about, How did you do it? 
    Audience: (laughter)
    Huang: And so with that, I have no other questions. (Laughs). First, first of all. Welcome. So, let me ask, let me frame it, let me break it down a bit. So, Morris, both of us are founders of our companies, and uhm, we think about building products, but not only that, we think about building companies. And in the process of building companies, we go through several phases and as I think of the history of NVIDIA, which you were involved in, many of the phases of my company. you know as you think of TSMC, what were the phases, distinct phases that you could remember ...
    Chang: Yeh. The first phase of course was just survival. We started the company with a lot of money, 220 million dollars, back in 1985-1986.
    Chang: .. considered to be a lot of money. a lot of money, even now I think. And particularly in Taiwan, In Taiwan, it was very difficult to raise that much money. As Jensen said, the government funded about half of it, about 48 percent, actually, of the 220 million. And Philips pitched in with another 27 percent. And the rest, about 25 percent, was from a dozen Taiwan investors. But, .. Anyway, 220 million dollars total was a lot of money and I was, uh, really ... The first priority was to protect that money. You know [...],  I can't afford to lose the money. So the first phase was survival. But I had a lot of experience, operating experience, before founding TSMC. So I had decided what the values of the company should be. Those values I think were very important to us. Not only the first phase but from then on. And we have maintained them. We have actually followed them. They are our compass really.
    Chang: The values are pretty simple. At first, there were just three. Integrity was number one. Commitment. We really wanted employees to be totally committed to TSMC. But in return, the company is committed to the employees, too. And also commitment applies to customers. We want the customers to be committed to TSMC. But we, in return, are totally committed to customers. So that's .. Ingegrity is pretty simple, self-explanatory. Commitment works between employees and the company, and between customers and the company. And then the third one is Innovation. We knew that we couldn't compete at all without constantly innovating. So those were our three values. And then we also had a vision. The vision changed. Values don't change. The three values that we had at the beginning are still values today.
    Huang: And in fact the first time I went to visit you in Taiwan. Instead of a presentation about all the capabilities of TSMC, you gave me a brochure of the core values of TSMC.  
    Chang: That's right. That's right. And I did the same thing ...
    Chang: ... with a lot of visitors, with every customer, with every potential customer, uh, and in the last 10-15 years, we, as you pointed out, we have been the most valuable company in Taiwan. So we have attracted a lot of public attention, too. Political candidates, usually before they started campaigning, would call on me. So the president, the presidential candidate came and they told me all his big vision about Taiwan, and I handed him our values: Integrity, Commitment and Innovation. Presidential candidates from both parties. And in fact, I thought that I detected in each of them a little surprise, you know. They got this, they don't know what to do with it. But look, every company goes through phases. First is the survival phase. And then is the rapid growth phase.
    Huang: Now when did you guys get traction? When did you guys get business traction? And you started to feel like, You know what, somebody is going to buy this?
    Chang: Well, that, that didn't happen. Because we, I guess we were too expensive, I think. Even from the, even at the beginning. Well the beginning, of course. Nobody ..
    Huang: Nothing's changed.
    Chang: Huh? Nobody wanted to ..
    Huang: You walked into that. You walked right into that. I didn't push you. You walked right into it.
    Chang: Nobody even wanted to invest in us. We were really considered to be not very hopeful. And that was the first two or three years, I think. At least, I would say from '87, we started in February of '87. And, '87, '88, '89, '90. So four years. Four years, it was touch and go, you know. But what really started us, what really gave us a big start was this rapid emergence of the fabless industry, companies like yours. Of course, yours came up.
    Huang: I'm practically the last fabless company.
    Chang: NVIDIA, yuh. NVIDIA of course rose pretty late in the game. You rose in the middle '90s. But there were several that started to rise in the early '90s. And, so those fabless companies really accelerated our growth. Now of course, we helped them. Actually, they wouldn't even have started if we weren't around, if we hadn't been around. They knew ..
    Huang: In fact, when NVIDIA started in 1993, there was no available foundry in the world.
    Chang: No, we were there, but you didn't consider us.
    Huang: I did consider, but you didn't call me back. Let it go on record that I tried to call Morris. I just didn't get a phone call back.
    Chang: Really? In '93?
    Huang: I called somebody in the local office. I don't want to throw anybody under the bridge here, but I didn't get a call back. I, I just .. Maybe, I called the wrong number, but ..
    Chang: But in '96 it was different. Right?
    Huang: Oh, '96? Yeh, '96 was completely different. Don't try to change the topic, so by 1996, '97, TSMC was about a billion dollars already.
    Chang: Yes.
    Huang: Right? And you, clearly .. I would guess by looking at the market cap, it was probably at one-and-a-half-billion-dollar company when you took the company public.
    Chang: Well, actually, when we went IPO in Taiwan, which was '94, we had a market cap of four billion dollars. And then you pointed out that in '97, when we went public in New York, we had a market cap of about six billion dollars.
    Huang: Now at the time, in 1997, when you and I met, NVIDIA was .. completed that year with 27 million dollars in revenues. We had a hundred people. And then we met. And it is, it is .. You guys don't believe this, but Morris used to make sales calls. You used to make house calls. Right? And you would come and visit customers. And I would explain to Morris what it is that NVIDIA did. And I would explain how big our die size needed to be and every year it was going to get bigger and bigger. And you would come back to NVIDIA periodically to make me tell the story over again just to make sure that I'm going to need that many wafers. And next year we started working with TSMC, NVIDIA did, I think it was, 127. And from that point forward we grew nearly a hundred percent per year until now. Our compounded annual growth rate over the last 10 years was seventy, seventy somewhat percent. And so, not once, not once, OK, maybe five times, did capacity get in the way of my growth. Four times last week.
    Audience: (laughter)
    Chang: But, honestly, all through the '90s, all through the '90s, and even now, even now, really the biggest joy I get out of this job, CEO or chairman of TSMC, the biggest pleasure I got out of it, was to see my customers grow and make money, and succeed.
    Huang: You know, I really .. I believe that.

    23:40 In 1993, we were the first company to attempt to make 3-D graphics consumerized. This was one year, two years before the PlayStation II was announced. Okay. And you guys know the PlayStation II, right? OK. All right. The PlayStation II by my calculations was probably the most important consumer 3-D machine. It made 3-D graphics more pervasive, than just any endeavor, even before we were successful doing so. But in 1993, two years before that happened, we were the first company started to try to attempt to do that for general-purpose computing PCs. And two years later, there were 90 companies. And we started earlier at a time when DRAM was (and just remember what I'm about to say here) DRAM, 1 megabyte of DRAM, 1 megabyte, not one gigabyte, 1 megabyte, 1 megabyte of DRAM was $50. OK, $50. And in order to have any convincing 3-D graphics, at a resolution of 640 x 480 VGA resolution, with the color buffer, two of them, front buffer, back buffer, and the Z buffer, OK. And enough space to hold textures, we needed about four megabytes. Four megabytes. Basically just the DRAM alone was, well, two hundred dollars. And then you had to build a chip to go manage the DRAM called the 3-D graphics chip, and then you've got to mark it up for your profit, and then your distributors have to mark it up for their profit. By the time that you've got this graphics card that does 3-D graphics, it was about a thousand dollars. And that's hardly a consumer price point.

    And so we invented this technology that made it possible, that made it possible, not to have a Z buffer, and not to keep texture memory in our frame buffer, but keep it in system memory. And we virtualized all this stuff, invented all this technology, and then two years later, 90 other companies showed up, 89 other companies showed up. And on one day, DRAM price fell from 50 dollars to five. And it did so, because DRAM pricing, I learned something about DRAMs, and the surrounding and the assumptions that you make in building your company, that the DRAM is not a technology-driven pricing thing. It is a supply-and-demand pricing thing. That's why they call it a commodity. It's a little bit like pork bellies and orange juice and those kind of things. If supply exceeds demand, then the price keeps coming down until the two meet. Well, somehow demand-supply equation changed and all of a sudden, the assumption, the fundamental assumption of our company, which is that inventing this technology (we called it forward texturing. No Z buffer was used. We used curved surfaces), that entire assumption collapsed. When the assumption that you're making about your surroundings changes in such a fundamental way, then everything about your company in fact changed. Now notice we had built a company with some assumptions right. That 3-D graphics was going to be good. But the technology that we had invented was based on an assumption that no longer was true. And we went from being the world's first company to be working on something to becoming the world's last company to be doing it right. Because every other company that was out there was using a technology based on OpenGL (which is the technology we are using today), using triangles, using Z buffers, using inverse texturing instead of forward texturing, curved surfaces and no Z buffers.

    And so, it was a night in 1995, and we were sitting here. We're running out of money. We have an enormous number of competitors. And our technology at this point, with no exception whatsoever, the industry considers to be wrong. It's wrong because the programming model is so different than everybody else's. And all the challenges of programming our architecture are unnecessary any more because DRAMs were so inexpensive. And so, in 1995, I still remember a very, very difficult night. And Chris, Curtis and I were now talking about what should we do. You know, what should we do? We were the first, and when you're the first, and you invented all the stuff that alleviated this huge cost of DRAMs, you felt like you had an advantage, a reason to exist. You might win. All of a sudden, you're the last in the world. Or, the first to do it wrong, however you want to think about it. Now, what do we do? Now, what do we do? If we were to adopt the same techniques that everybody else adopted, we would be one of 90 people. They were better funded than we are at this point. And we're running out of time because when you're a start-up, money is time. And you're running out of time. And what do you do? And it was rigorous.. you know, rigorous discussion. Talking at each other at incredibly high volumes. Okay. And the question is what should we do. And ultmately, I think, the psychology or the sensibility that won the night is this: Maybe we don't know whether we can win if we did it the way everybody else did it. But doing it the wrong way, certainly won't let you get to the right place. And so at this point, it is clear that we are doing it the wrong way. And nobody is going to support our architecture in the way we define 3-D graphics if it's unnecessary.

    So we decided that night to go home and say, Look, we're going to stop doing it the way that we did it. We're going to stop the fundamental technology that we invented our company to go do. That we still believe in the future of 3-D graphics. That we still believe in each other. That was net-net how we went home. How we would continue to be successful, don't know. What strategy we would find to differentiate ourselves, don't know. And how we would get the rest of the money to build a chip the right way: inverse texturing and Z buffered, triangle-based, don't know. But those are in the final analysis what I would consider details, you know, at this point, although they didn't seem like details at the time. It didn't seem like details at the time. It seems like details now to me. The two things that were quite fundamental, that I continue to believe to be true, and would have been enough, would have been enough for me, to have started the company altogether, was two things: One, do I believe in that work? Is this something that we would love to do? Is this something that we could be world-class at doing? Is this something that is hard enough to do that we could do it for a long period of time. And the question about my team mates: Are these people that I want to go to battle with? Are these people that I want to stay up all night with? And do we believe in each other? Those two questions, if I got the right answers from, would have been more than plenty, to start something new. 

    And so, we went home. We came back and the next day was where the rubber meets the road. And we said, Okay, so one of the founders said, Okay, all right, now we've decided we're going to do this, what's our strategy?

    6:54: Rose: Are these things that you and your company are creating for these people? In other words, do you see the need and so therefore, in an entrepeneurial and a creative way, you make the product. Or do people in need come to you and say, Is it possible to do this with your GPU? Or can you imagine a GPU that could solve this problem for me?

    Huang: Well, you know, that's a good question. It's a little bit of both. You know, if you ask me what I do for a living, ultimately, what we do is we solve some of the greatest challenges of computing in the world. And so, we know what our tool is. And we know what our expertise is. And we try to put ourselves in situations where people who have extraordinary challenges ..

    It could be a .. One of my favorite stories is a couple of doctors at Mass General. And they would like to use the GPU in a very specific way. And they had this .. They learned about the GPU, and they thought, Wouldn't it be great if we used the computational capabilitiy of the GPU to reconstruct CT scan data in real time, so that they could do a mammogram in real time before the patient goes home, and truly discover whether that person has cancer or not, right there. Okay?

    And the, one of the challenges that they have is the data they sort through is so great that there is a lot of false detections. And that scares the patient obviously. And so, if you just had the .. if you could render the woman's breast in three-dimensional volume metric precision, you could actually go through it layer by layer. And almost any novice can detect whether there's breast cancer or not. And so, the computational capability was really vast. And they didn't think that it was possible unless they went to use this new device called the GPU.

    And so they came to us and they said, Look. We're going to .. we would like to do this thing. The outcome of this project is likely either a paper, or we'll buy a few GPUs. And so, you know, we manufacture about a hundred million a year. And here's a couple of doctors who would like to buy two or three, when they're all said and done. And the project would take about a year and a half or so.

    We love those kind of opportunities, because it really takes us into spaces that we've never been to before. As a result of that, they published a paper. It became a huge craze in medical imaging. Now we're engaged with every medical imaging company in the world. It took us to places that we just simply didn't know. The same capability in imaging could be used for Adobe's Photoshop now. So that you could do things in digital photography that is now becoming a field called computational photography. Really exciting.

    Rose: And how much of your business today is still in gaming, or games?

    Huang: Well, I would say, I would say, that, you know, call it twenty percent of our business, maybe thirty percent of our business goes towards people who are hard-core gamers. And they just, you know, this is what they live and breathe. And they always want the latest generation technology. They want to always have the best gear.

    In that business, we're a little bit like Nike. We are the gear of choice of cyber-athletes.  They're playing games, just like people who play basketball and football. And so, I think they see us kind of like a Nike. In the case of these doctors and scientists and engineers, you know, we're probably like Silicon Graphics to them, used to be. We're the company that provides the technology.

    Rose: The technology graphics company, right.

    Huang: That's right. That famous graphics technology company in Silicon Valley that really brought 3-D graphics to mainstream because of the work that they do with Jurassic Park and Terminator. And many of those engineers now work at NVIDIA. And the work is very important.

    Rose: A bit of biography before. Because you have a very interesting life. You're how old now?

    Huang: I'm 45.

    Rose: You're 45. You started the company when you were ..?

    Huang: 30.

    Rose: Before that, I mean you kind of bounced around several states. Tell me the story. And had a learning experience that serves you well.

    Huang: Well, I .. we were in Thailand. I was just about almost 10 years old. And recently Thailand had a coup.

    Rose: Right.
    Huang: Well, in 1973, they had a coup. And I think it was 1973, 1975 or something like that. And my parents thought that it was unsafe for us to be there. And, so my parents put my older brother and me on a plane and sent us to Tacoma, Washington, where my uncle was. From there, they put us in a private school, a boarding school. And the one that they selected, I'm not exactly sure why, but my parents didn't know the United States very well. And probably didn't know that Kentucky was very far away from Washington.

    So we ended up in a small town in Kentucky called Oneida. The website's still up. It's the Oneida Baptist Institute. And so my older brother and me went to Oneida Baptist Institute for about a year and a half or so. And it was a fabulous experience. We were the only two Chinese kids that had been there. And this was during the time when the United States was still rather learning about foreigners and so everybody asked me whether I knew kungfu. Because of Bruce Lee. And obviously I didn't. But I was very good in math. And so all of the local kids took to me, because I could help them with homework and things like that.

    It was a small school. My job during the afternoons. After you go to school, everybody has a task. My job would be to clean all the bathrooms at the dorm. There's a dorm with about 300 kids. And my older brother's job--he was one year older than me, so he was 11 years old--his job was to work in the tobacco farm. And so we would do this until my parents came. And then we flew back to Washington where we met up with them.

    But it was .. People say, Jensen, you went to a school and it turned out that .. I'm not too sure how they positioned the school and why we went to it. But it's a boarding school for international students, somehow, that also a reform school. So I don't know how they got into that business. But it turned out that there were a lot of challenging, very, very difficult and tough kids. My roommate was 17 years old and I still remember when we were getting ready for bed that night, you know, he took off his shirt, and he had stab wounds all over his body. Turned out to be a wonderful kid. Didn't know how to read, but turned out to be a wonderful kid. And I learned a lot in that school.
