## Ingredients for success

1. An innovation (a new, good idea)
2. A good team
	o ability to persuade others of your vision
	o understanding of cash flow
	o experience 
		- with your customers
		- with your product
		- with new businesses
	o contacts (people who you can ask for help)
3. a market opportunity (Do people want to buy what you are selling?)

- [Selling refrigerators to Eskimos--No market opportunity](http://www.toonpool.com/user/5817/files/global_warming_precaution_677585.jpg)
- If people are not buying what you are selling and you are losing money, you don't have a market opportunity.
- If other companies are competing with you and you are losing, you don't have a market opportunity.

4. a financing strategy (How do you get money?)

a measure of importance for a given web page.

# The ingredients at TSMC

## TSMC headed for failure

TSMC was successful because of ``fabless'' companies like NVIDIA, but ..

Between '87 and '91, it looked like TSMC was going to fail because of one of innovative idea, team, market opportunity, or financial strategy. Which one?

## Cbang's experience in the US

A: Chang worked at Texas Instruments in the U.S. for 25 years. He had been responsible for manufacturing its semiconductors. Sometimes Texas Instruments made semiconductors for other big companies when it wasn't producing its own. He saw that this service was a possible business model. This was Chang's innovative idea. People in the US didn't understand. What the hell's Chang trying to do in Taiwan, they said.

## Chang comes to Taiwan and starts TSMC

B: After leaving Texas Instruments. Chang came to Taiwan and helped advise the government on technological development at 工業技術研究院. He got to know 曾繁城 there and in the government, 李國鼎 wanted him to start a Taiwanese semiconductor company and promised to help him.

## Taiwan's strengths, and raising money

C: Chang knew Taiwan had few strengths, so creating the company would be difficult. But the government raised a lot of money to start the company and forced rich businessmen to put money into it too. Philips was a willing investor.

## TSMC headed for failure, but miraculously from '91 becomes successful

D: Between '87 and '91, TSMC had to rely on a few orders from the big semiconductor companies just like when he had been at Texas Instruments. Their own manufacturing plants were too busy, so they got TSMC to make their chips. But from '91, many ``fabless'' companies became TSMC customers.
