    A: You and your friends are very enthusiastic about your new idea to make money on the Internet, and 1) they are very good about making other people enthusiastic. 2) You have a lot of business knowledge and they have a lot of 3) experience writing Web applications, and experience helping other people use them. You worked with them in a previous start-up. 4) You have many different contacts. 5) You and they are willing to work hard.
    B: Making money from the Internet is hard, because everything there is free. You need to think about a new business model. You can't expect people to pay you for your software. It is too easy to copy software. They will get it from a friend. People (eg Google) do however make money, because some people are prepared to spend money. Heavy users of software are prepared to pay for other services, eg hosting of their sites on your servers, or help with problems using your software.
    C: Because everything is free, you don't need as much money as in other areas to set up an Internet business. However you and your team all need to eat and live somewhere. You also may need lots of computers, which are not cheap. You need to be able to find some way of getting the money to do that. That means having a business plan you can show to people who might be willing to loan you money, but who need to be persuaded they can make money too.
    D: Google made lots of money from the fact the Internet doesn't have a telephone book, classified by the kind of company that has the telephone number. Unlike the telephone system, there is no one organization which is in control of the whole of the Internet. In the real world, you can walk around and see what service you want. For example, here, there's a 7-11. There, there's the post office. On the Internet, you are blind and need help.
