    A: You and your friends are very enthusiastic about your new idea to make money on the Internet, and 1) they are very good about making other people enthusiastic. 2) You have a lot of business knowledge and they have a lot of 3) experience writing Web applications, and experience helping other people use them. You worked with them in a previous start-up. 4) You have many different contacts. 5) You and they are willing to work hard.
    B: Making money from the Internet is hard, because everything there is free. You need to think about a new business model. You can't expect people to pay you for your software. It is too easy to copy software. They will get it from a friend. People (eg Google) do however make money, because some people are prepared to spend money. Heavy users of software are prepared to pay for other services, eg hosting of their sites on your servers, or help with problems using your software.
    C: Because everything is free, you don't need as much money as in other areas to set up an Internet business. However you and your team all need to eat and live somewhere. You also may need lots of computers, which are not cheap. You need to be able to find some way of getting the money to do that. That means having a business plan you can show to people who might be willing to loan you money, but who need to be persuaded they can make money too.
    D: Google made lots of money from the fact the Internet doesn't have a telephone book, classified by the kind of company that has the telephone number. Unlike the telephone system, there is no one organization which is in control of the whole of the Internet. In the real world, you can walk around and see what service you want. For example, here, there's a 7-11. There, there's the post office. On the Internet, you are blind and need help.

    A: In Taiwan, many people would like to be able to speak English. Many parents want their children to learn English, so they can succeed in their careers. Many people however don't want to put the effort that remembering many words and grammar forms requires. They also do not want the pain and embarrassment that talking to foreigners often involves. Easy and fun learning, however, is popular.
    B: The financial requirements of a language school are mainly salaries for teachers and administrative staff and rent for an office and classrooms. A bank loan to cover these for 1-2 months would not be difficult for someone with credit with a bank. Dr Bean is not worried about his ability to get a loan.
    C: Dr Bean's innovation is his determination, flexibility, intelligence, innovative teaching techniques, friendliness, easygoing nature, knowledge of languages, understanding of psychology, business understanding, wide cultural knowledge of the West and Japan, Korea and Taiwan, wide life experience, his university degrees, and his preparedness for hardwork and hardship.
    D: Dr Bean's team is minimal. He has his wife, who is Japanese, and who has does not have much business sense. He is good at saving money, but not at using cashflow to drive the business. He is also not very good at making people enthusiastic about what he is enthusiastic about. He is experienced at teaching English, and interacting with customers, but not at setting up and running a new business. He also doesn't have many contacts with other teachers or Taiwanese people in general.

    A: In Taiwan, many people do not know English but want to learn it. Many parents also want their children to learn English. Any school which can show that it has a new or improved solution to language learning, like Dr Bean, can make a lot of money.
    B: Dr Bean is uncomfortable with the idea of borrowing money to set up a school. He is not confident of success. He doesn't think people with money will be enthusiastic about his school. He doesn't have any contacts in the finance industry.
    C: Dr Bean's innovation is his understanding that a little stress is exciting but a lot of stress is bad. He is able to control the stress learners feel and this helps them learn. When students study with Dr Bean, they learn a lot faster.
    D: Dr Bean has an enthusiastic group of Taiwanese friends who use his methods teaching their classes. They know how to use cashflow to control the business. Many of them have worked in new language schools before. And, they all work hard.

    A: Dr Bean's plans to get the money from investors to set up his school. He will approach his contacts with a well-written business plan. Writing the plan will help him think about the goals of his school. It will help him decide how to use cashflow to drive the business, and to expand and contract. His contacts will include banks and venture capital companies.
    B: The company will only succeed if there are people who want to study English with Dr Bean. Although many young people want to study English, the Taiwan economy is not good. Many people are out of work and have no money. These young people can find many free, stress-free and more interesting resources on the Internet like podcasts, Second Life, and skype :-(
    C: Dr Bean has developed a Dictation Exercise. The student listens to a sound file, types in the word, and if it is correct the word appears in a transcript of a question that has to be answered. Another innovation is a conversation-like Comprehension Competition. Two competitors ask each other questions about information that each has, in order to understand more than their partner does.
    D: Dr Bean and his wife make others excited about what they're doing, and understand cashflow. They have experience at teaching English and Japanese and experience with dealing with Taiwanese students. They also have worked in new businesses before. They are very different and their wide contacts are very different too. They are comfortable with hard work and hardship.

    A: Many young people are out of work, but surprisingly, this is good news for language schools. Many people are paying large sums to improve their language skills and study for TOEIC and GEPT. In fact, in all of Taiwan, there is an English boom. If you don't pass the language exams, you can't graduate from college. Students are finding it difficult to pass the exams, so they are looking for help from language schools.
    B: Dr Bean's plan is to use his team's contacts in the financial industry to get the money from investors to set up his school. The team has a good reputation with banks and banks think language schools are good places to invest their money. Although Huang didn't write a business plan, Dr Bean will approach his contacts with a well-written business plan. Writing the plan will help him think about the goals of his school. It will help him decide how to use cashflow to drive the business, and to expand and contract.
    C: Dr Bean developed a Dictation Exercise a couple of years ago, but he is not improving it. Similar exercises using the computer have been developed by other language teachers, but none of them is really popular. The Internet is popular, but the Internet doesn't really play a part in the exercise. Another CompComp exercise is supposed to be a competitive exercise, but students don't compete and don't use English. It's not something that will make money for him.
    D: Dr Bean has an enthusiastic group of Taiwanese teachers who believe in his methods and who have good contacts. They want to form a language school with him. At college they majored in business management so they know how to use cashflow to control how the business is going. Many of them have worked in new language schools before, so they have lot of experience. Lastly, they all like working hard. They know it may be hard.

       \item [Innovation] Dr Bean doesn't constantly develop new teaching techniques. Every week it's the same thing. But students don't complain.
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \item [Financial strategy] Dr Bean is uncomfortable with the idea of borrowing money to set up a school. He is not confident of success. He doesn't think people with money will be enthusiastic about his school.
