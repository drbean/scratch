    What's important, I think, is to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Also, get to know your co-workers and do things with them after work and on the weekends. Get together not just with people in the same office, but with workers in other parts of your company too.

    All this is a lot of work, so you need to have a life outside work. You need to spend time with your family. Have a good time with them, so that you can come back to work feeling good. This will help you do a good job at the company.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Keep that in mind.

    But have your own goals. Your goals are different than your company's goals. Do you want to be doing the same thing for the rest of your career? Think also about what kind of work you want to be doing in the future and think about what you have to do to get that kind of work.

    If you're unhappy with your present job, don't just accept it and keep on working in the job, even though you don't like it. Find ways to make the job a better job in your eyes. If you can't make the job a better job, look for a new job.

    Don't think of your job as something just you do. You are part of a team. Your success depends on what the other people in your team do too. Make sure other people understand that their success depends on what you do too. If they know you are working for them, this will make it easier for you to get them to work for you.

    Be dissatisfied if things are too easy. Prefer to do the difficult thing. Solving a difficult problem, or surviving a difficult situation is very satisfying. But, be prepared for failure and learn from that failure. Try something different and achieve something great.

    It's also important to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Try to better yourself all the time. There is always some skill you can learn for your job and how to do it better. If the company offers you training, take the training. You can study too, part-time at colleges in the evening or weekend, and by reading. Be a life-long learner.

    Talk to your boss. Let management know what you think. If you want something, ask for it. They may not give it to you, but perhaps they will negotiate with you for something less. A raise which is smaller than you wanted is better than no raise at all.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Understand what you are doing.

    Eva is German and aged forty-two. She has a university degree in history. She has worked for over fifteen years as a sales representative in Germany, the U.S. and Poland. She joined Fast-Track a year ago. She has had a good sales record in all her previous jobs. In her first year with Fast-Track, her sales results have been satisfactory.
    She speaks fluent German, English and Polish.
    During the interview, she appeared quiet, but also strong. She was rather nervous at the interview. She might be good at team-building, but would probably be too dependent on other people. She likes administration, but doesn't appear to have many ideas about the future of the company.

  - Thinking about your career--Would you be a good candidate?
  - business
  - all
  - |+
    First, we looked at ways to think about your career. For example, is it important to talk much with the boss about our dreams and ambitions? Should we get together with people in other parts of the company? Next we compared three candidates for a new sales manager position. We had to think whether the candidate would be a good leader and good administrator.

    What is the relationship between these two exercises? The issues are ones that you face together when you think about your position and decide it is not satisfying.

    Companies want new employees who have thought about their career and who have tried to improve it. However in interviews, it is difficult for both interviewer and interviewee to talk about this. Our mental lives are private.

    Sometimes the best candidate will fail to get the job, and a weaker candidate will be chosen. But it is our inner self which finally determines what kind of career we have, rather than the people or society around us.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    To be successful, the website must be easy to find and good to look at. It must have good images and good information, technical information, about the things on sale. There needs to be clear information about prices and special offers. Information about delivery of the products is very important, too. Also the site must be fast and easy to navigate. It must be easy to find things on the site and it must be easy to order the goods and pay for them.

    If you have all these things, then customers will keep coming back.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Not everyone likes buying online, because they don't want to see a picture. They want to see the real thing. Some people feel insecure, handing over their money before getting the item. Other people like the experience of shopping, being seen, entering stores, seeing things and talking to store people.

    Every customer is an individual and different, at the same time as they are all similar. Customers who also like to use websites are also different. And even the same customer is different on different days. Sometimes they will look at the website and then go into a store. Sometimes they will order online.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Argos is a big retailer with many stores all over the U.K. which also has an online operation. It tries to integrate its two different forms of retailing, because its experience is that sometimes a customer will buy online and at other times the same customer will check the website to find information and then go into a store to buy the item. 

    So it has to understand, or try to recognize, what customers want to do on the site while they are still there. It also has to keep prices in its stores the same as prices for the same goods online.

      Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to shop. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

      The Internet is having a big influence on the retail market. Internet retailers can offer cut-throat prices because they do not have to run stores. Websites that publish comparisons of the prices on top online retailers make the market even more competitive.

      Some retailers who sell both online and in stores have tried to handle this problem by charging different prices for goods on their websites and in their stores.

      This dual pricing is becoming harder to practice as customers become better at surfing the Internet. Some people say retailers should integrate their operations so shoppers can buy online and pick up their purchases in stores.

  - IBM advice to online retailers about advocacy--The purpose of the study

    VanTine: Good afternoon. This is Laura VanTine, and today I'll be speaking with Maureen Stancik Boyce, IBM's Institute for Business Values distribution team leader about their IBV study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.  Welcome, Maureen.
    Stancik Boyce: Thanks Laura. I'm excited to talk about our study today, because there's a lot of great information. And I think can really help our clients in this economic environment. 
    VanTine: So let's start out with the general purpose of the study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. The reason we did this study was to get deeper knowledge about consumers who shop online. We conducted a study of US consumers. And it was about twenty-five hundred consumers. We wanted to understand how they feel about their shopping experience. We also wanted to understand how strong is the customer support for their primary online retailer. So they might shop at multiple retailers, but we asked who do you shop at most often. And that's how we defined their primary online retailer.

    We also asked questions about what elements of the online customer experience were most important to the customers. We wanted to understand how well different online retailers were positioned, how good a job they're doing, and offering what the customer wants. And so we kind of ranked the different retailers across each other, how many advocates they do or do not have.

    We also wanted to understand what advocates look like, demographically, what's important to them, stuff like that, and how valuable they are.

    And finally we wanted to understand what actions an online retailer could take in order to gain more advocates.

    VanTine: Can you please explain a little bit more what you mean by advocacy?
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. And that is very important. So advocacy really is defined by three components. The first thing is, likelihood to recommend, the second is purchase intent, and the third is staying rate. And let me define each of those. So the first, likelihood to recommend. That's typical in any kind of CRM, or loyalty study, and that is, would a consumer recommend their primary retailer to family and friends. So that's the first criteria. So IBM has added two others that we feel really help define and show the difference between the casual advocate versus the true advocate.

    The second criteria is purchase intent. And that means a customer's willingness to purchase new products from their primary retailer that they normally buy elsewhere. So an example would be that an online retailer offers only clothes now, and if they started offering accessories, which they can't purchase currently, that they would in fact buy them, accessories, from that same retailer.

    And the third criteria that we used is staying rate. And that means if a new retailer opened up that offered similar products at a similar price point, would the consumer switch to the new retailer or would they stay with the current primary retailer. And if they would stay, they get a check mark in there at staying rate.

    So that anyone who might say yes to two or even one of the three criteria might be defined more as an apathetic. And those who say no to all of the three criteria would certainly be an antagonist, someone who does not like their primary retailer.

  - |+
    VanTine: Why should retailers care so much if their shoppers are advocates or not?
    Stancik Boyce: Well, the key reason truly is financial. Advocates are more valuable customers. Our survey showed that on average, an advocate's share of wallet is actually thirty-three percent higher than the antagonist's. So they spend a lot more money. Advocates spend a lot more money with their primary retailer than do antagonists. Advocates' basket size is also greater. So they spend thirty percent more dollars with their primary retailer than do the antagonists. And then finally advocates are spending more over time. Sixty-five percent of advocates have increased the amount they're purchasing over the past two years. And conversely, there are fewer advocates have decreased their spending over time with their primary retailer, only four percent. The number is higher for antagonists at six percent.

    So in summary, advocates are more valuable becuase they spend a greater percent of their money online, and they spend more than other customers, than the antagonists and the apathetics. And they are increasing their spending over time. So the fact that they spend more and are more loyal, so they stay with their primary retailer longer, really their customer lifetime value is much higher than the average customer.

    VanTine: Since advocates are so valuable, do you have any insights into how retailers can build more advocates. For instance, can you explain what are the factors that drive advocacy and what may be the key areas that are so important to advocates.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. That is actually an important part of our survey that we wanted to understand these factors.

    What we found out is that advocates really find convenience, customer service and the store, quote unquote, experience very important for online retailers. So let me explain a little bit more. What we did is, we asked survey respondents how they feel their primary retailer is doing on a list of statements that we call attributes. So, different parts of the shopping experience. We had a list of fifteen things and we asked the survey respondents, 'Does your primary retailer do this well?'

    That list of fifteen were bucketed into different areas and what we did then is analysis on what advocates were saying versus the apathetics versus the antagonists. And we found that advocates largely agreed that the store are doing things well. It was in the eighty, ninety percentile that they agreed that these attributes were done well by their primary retailer. Conversely, the antagonists and apathetics were much lower. Only twenty, thirty, maybe a couple of situations, forty percent of the antagonists were saying, 'Yes, my retailer does this well.' But what was interesting is that the rank ordering of the things that most people agreed well were in the same order, advocates and antagonists. So we said, Um, these are the most important attributes. It's just that the antagonists are not getting them from their primary retailer.

    So what we found was the absolute top-rated attribute was, 'My online retailer makes it easy to shop.' So that is bucketed into convenience. We said, that's an attribute that really is related to convenience.

    The second highest-rated attribute was, 'I'm happy with the service I receive from online store employees.' So even though a consumer was not in the store, the customer service, when they need help, they want to be able to get help. The consumer wants the help from somebody at the store. Customer service is second in importance.

    And then third we found the statement, 'It was pleasant and enjoyable to shop at this online retailer.' That was the attribute rated third most important.

    You, together with B, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
    You want the website operating within one month. The quicker it is up, the better. But you realize the designer needs time to develop the site.
    You want the website to have lots of information and different links that the user can click.
    You want to pay the designer 6,000 dollars. This seems a reasonable amount of money. You think if you offer less than this, the designer won't be willing to do it, or won't do a good job.
    You want to pay the designer when the site is finished and operating, so you can be sure it works and is acceptable.
    You would like the site to show individual images of all the covers of the books that the bookstore sells. Images are always more interesting than text. They give the reader an idea of what the book is like.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them are not negotiable. You aren't willing to compromise on them. B has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will C and D accept your position?

    You are not willing to compromise on the time that A said. The site is very important to doing business. You are ready to send books to buyers, but the only way the buyers can contact you or even know you are doing business is through the web site. The quicker the site is up, the better.
    You are not concerned about the amount of information on the site just now. You are ready to negotiate the number of pages and links on the site. In fact, any amount is okay.
    You are not willing to pay more than the price A said. It is a fixed price which you can't negotiate.
    You are ready to compromise on when the designer is paid, perhaps some in advance before the designer starts work, and some after the site is up and working.
    A told C and D what Michelle wants in terms of the number of images and the amount of text on the site, but she is willing to compromise on this. She realizes that changes can be made later.
    You don't have to change your position if C and D will accept what A said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which offers will C and D find unacceptable? And will C and D accept your new position?

    You want to take two months to get the website up and operating. Your reason it you have a lot of other work to do and you want to do a good job on Michelle's site, even though you realize she wants it up quickly.
    You want to limit the amount of information on the website and the different links that the user can click. Michelle probably will want the site redesigned, and a simpler design will make redesigning easier. It will also be quicker to finish a simpler design.
    You want to charge Michelle fifty dollars an hour. This seems a reasonable amount of money. It's the normal fee for the job.
    You want to limit the size of the site. Rather than individual images of all the covers of all the books that the bookstore sells, you want to have bigger images of a few of the popular books. This will mean users don't have to wait so long to see the images.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them may not be negotiable. You may not be willing to compromise on them. D has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will A and B accept your position?

    The designer is willing to incorporate Michelle's ideas into the design of the website, together with your ideas.
    The designer is willing to be paid a fixed price rather than the way A mentioned. But in return, he/she would want half of the fee to be paid in advance, before starting work.
    C told A and B about the problem of images. The designer however is willing to compromise on images, perhaps one or two images of individual covers of books on each page.

    Car hire and insurance: It does not want these to be part of the venture. People who want these probably will not order online.
    Advertising: It wants to invest 100,000 dollars in advertising on a fifty-fifty basis. Direct Sun probably has its own ideas about advertising so it should use its own money to try those ideas out.
    Structure: It wants to manage the project because it has greater management experience and knowledge.

    Mark: Today's the big day. IKEA is letting me move into their store for a week. First, I need to introduce myself to the people I'm going to live with for the next week--the great employees of IKEA. Now that I'm living here, it's kind of like they're working for me.

    ...

    So everyone I've met here at IKEA so far has been really friendly. The janitor Louis, is very knowledgeable and friendly. If you need any help, (To Louis) I'm happy to mop, or do whatever you want. Nice meeting you.

    Louis: Nice meeting you, too.

    Cashier: I think it's pretty weird. I mean to stay here for six days and, you know, six nights, or whatever. 

    Mark: Right now, we have forty-five minutes until the store opens, so we have to find the bedroom set of my dream. There are hundreds to choose from. But, this has to be the best bedroom set ever. Let's do it. 

    And then I found it. The perfect place for me to crash for the week. Wow! This is it.

    Cool, man. I can make cookies tonight. Wow. Bake pasta. This is awesome. All my cooking needs. A refrigerator. Wow! A bedroom set for the twins I don't have. This place has everything. An apartment like this in New York City would cost three thousand dollars a month.

    Let's see what they have in the wardrobe. Oh, this is cute. Let's see what they left for me. Oh, wow. Well, this is hot. I love that the hanger comes with it. You can't remove the hanger from the clothing. They're based out of Sweden. This must be the latest fashion. This is hot.

    IKEA even gave me some free stuff. The Swedish are the kings of hospitality.

    On behalf of IKEA, we'd like to present you with these gifts, welcoming you into the neighborhood.

    Mark: My gosh. Thank you so much. Um, Scott, I'm going to be here all week. So if you want to hang out, definitely stop by. We'll have a lot of fun. Just, next time you come up, knock. Okay.

    Scott: Okay. I will. Sorry about that.

    Mark: Don't worry about it.

    One thing about living in this store is you get lots of house guests.

    One of you guys want to help shave me?

    All right. I'm living in IKEA. Mark's living in IKEA.

    What do you want to do when you grow up?

    Oh, ladies. Come on in. First take off your shoes.

    Ow.

    This is pull-out? I don't know. Pillow fight. 

    Is there a reason you guys are in my house?

    Store customers: Oh, I'm so sorry.

    Mark: I think I have a concussion.

    Cashier: People like overly looking at you. A whole week. I mean, what'd you do? 

    Mark: Wait. Hold on. What are you doing?

    Store customer: I'm purchasing this chair.

    Mark: This is my chair. I live here. Put it down! 

    Store customer: Sorry.

  - business

    Uniqlo is a Japanese clothing brand. It started as a small suit maker in 1963 and is now one of the biggest Japanese clothing companies.

    Uniqlo's name has always been connected to the Japanese music scene. Its customers are young and fashionable.

    Uniqlo has developed a unique marketing mix. It has the right combination of product, price, promotion and place.

    If a clothes company wants to be successful, it needs to have the right marketing mix. Every company has a different marketing mix of product, price, promotion and place.

    The product is what Uniqlo sells. The price is how much the customer pays. Promotion is what Uniqlo does to keep Uniqlo in customers' minds. Place is where and how the customer buys Uniqlo clothes.

    The company has to make the right decisions about all of product, price, promotion and place to make the most money. And decisions about each of these things affects decisions about the other things.

    Uniqlo has to design clothes and see if customers like them. But, it also has to know what clothes will be popular in the next six months, in spring or fall, and produce those kind of clothes.

    In the fashion industry, clothes are only fashionable for a short time. Uniqlo has to change the style of its clothes all the time.

    New styles are developed for the spring and fall season. But when one style of clothes is becoming popular, small changes are continually made in the style to keep it popular.

    If these continual small changes are not made, the style can quickly lose popularity.

    Uniqlo has to decide who is going to buy its clothes and decide how much they are willing to pay. It also has to decide how much it costs to produce its clothes. It has to choose a price which covers these costs.

    Uniqlo products are medium-priced. People are willing to pay a little more for them because it shows they are successful in their lives.

    It is not a low-priced brand. The clothes of people who buy low-priced brands show those people want value for the price they pay.

    It is not a high-priced brand. People who buy a high-priced brand will buy it, even if it is cheaper, or even if it is more expensive. People who buy high-priced brands want clothes which are different or have the latest styles.

    Place is where Uniqlo products may be bought and also the ways the clothes are delivered or distributed to these places.

    Uniqlo controls very carefully the places where its clothes may be bought. It has its own stores, and it has places in department stores, where the customer feels they are in a special Uniqlo store.

    It wants to create an environment where the customer has a unique Uniqlo experience. If people can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere, they don't have that special Uniqlo experience.

    And people will think the Uniqlo brand is less fashionable if they can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere.

    The purpose of promotion is to get customers. Promotion includes advertising in magazines or on TV, and mailing of catalogs and newsletters to customers. It also includes getting famous people to wear Uniqlo clothes, the way Michael Jordan endorsed Nike shoes.

    Japanese rappers Scha Dara Parr wear Uniqlo clothes. They are paid by Uniqlo to endorse the brand.

    Other forms of promotion include discounts, give-away competitions, and participation in public events.

    Promotion also includes the style of its public image, that is, the look of Uniqlo stores, Uniqlo displays, Uniqlo packaging and the Uniqlo logo 

    All these things have an effect on sales of Uniqlo clothes.

    CLB: So many people have lost their jobs. I am afraid I will be next. Because we work in the Human Resources department, we were responsible for firing those people. Now it is our turn to be fired. It's funny, in a way.

    It would be okay if there were less work to do, but with fewer and fewer people here now, there is more and more work to do.

    We are under a lot of pressure and there is never enough time to do a good job. In a way, I will be glad when I'm fired. Not really, of course. But, the stress is killing me.

    I just can't cope any more.

    SLT: My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable. Everything that doesn't go according to management's plan is my or someone else's fault, management says.

    That would be okay if I felt like what I did had an effect. But I don't feel like I have any control over what is happening. Nothing I do seems to have an effect. It's a very stressful situation.

    It would also be okay if had some freedom to make my own decisions. But none of us are allowed to think for ourselves. Management is always telling us what to do. Everything we do is monitored. We are expected to follow orders blindly.

    And management is not supportive. We are not told we are doing a good job. We are only blamed when management is unhappy. Management doesn't care if we are happy or not. And it doesn't help us to do things which we think are difficult.

    I feel like I am falling off a cliff. I can't take it any more.

    Oh, I have a chair and a desk, but I have to share it. And there are always people I don't know walking past me. It is crowded and there are three other people, all in the same area, without even a window.

    It's also very noisy with five telephones always ringing, people shouting, and others interrupting me. 

    The computers and the air conditioning are noisy too, when they're not broken. Often it's too hot in the office to work.

    And of course, I don't have my own computer. I have to share one with the three other people in the same space. I wish they wouldn't download all those files they do. The computer has lots of viruses, of course.

    I think I deserve my own office. But I don't get the treatment I deserve from the company, I think.

    Alan: I, and everyone else, is really unhappy with our manager. We can't talk to her. She never listens to what we say. The only time she talks to us is when she has some new order to give us. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.' It's impossible to have a conversation with her.

    She never tries to understand our point of view. When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.' Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. 

    I've been patient. We've all been patient, hoping things would change. But the worse the situation the company is in, the worse she has become. She just won't make any effort to see our point of view.

    She also never tells us what management is thinking. We have no idea about what management's plans are. If she told us more about what is happening, we would feel much less stress.

    Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault and to say other unpleasant things. 

    We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.

    BDL: I think the best thing to improve the health and well-being of our staff is to improve the food in the company cafeteria. Generally, the food here isn't healthy. If someone just ate the food available in the company cafeteria, they wouldn't be getting a balanced diet. There is too much fatty, salty, starchy and sweet food, and not enough fish, fruit and vegetables.

    And the food here is not good for people's stress levels. You know how drinking coffee or coke can make you feel more tense and excited? That's stress. And research has shown that fatty, salty, starchy and sweet foods also raise people's stress levels.

    To reduce these levels, we need to have more natural foods, like fish, fruit and vegetables, in the cafeteria. Perhaps they don't taste so good as the food we have now, but people will feel more relaxed and will live better lives.

    SLT: To reduce stress here at the company, I think it's important that everyone be involved in a lot of physical activity, like jogging, or swimming, or basketball.

    It would be nice to have our own basketball court and swimming pool, but that would be very expensive.

    Instead, I think we should talk to the manager of the local sports center and arrange a group membership for everyone at the company. That would probably also be expensive, but the sports center has a good pool and a sauna.

    I think a lot of workers would enjoy a swim at lunch time or after work. The sauna is also very relaxing.

    And I'm sure their basketball court would be very popular. Even now, many people here are members of the sports center, and they use the basketball court during the lunch hour or after work.

    They also have a weight room, where people can use exercise machines.

    KED: I think, to improve everyone's well-being and reduce stress at the company, we should have company tours. Every month, we should all go in buses to an amusement park, or climb a mountain and have a picnic.

    Once or twice a year, we should travel to some place of interest, here or overseas, and spend a few days together seeing scenic spots, and having fun.

    As an example, I think it would be fun and relaxing for everyone in the company to go to Korea and go shopping and eat Korean food, and bring back some Korean souvenirs.

    In winter, we could go skiing there. In summer, it would be nice too, because it would be a lot cooler than Taiwan.

    When people are having fun, they can forget about work, and they will come back with good feelings about the company.

    So, my idea is one-day company tours, once a month, and three- or four- day tours, once or twice a year.

    The Long Beach Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco is a five-star hotel on the beach, so it is very nice, but there is not much to do in the area around the hotel. 
    
    It has a lot of nice facilities, like a large swimming pool and a sauna, and a very large tropical garden where you can sit and eat and drink. It also has shops and a good nightclub where you can have fun in the evening.

    But there is not much you can do when you go outside the hotel. The town is one hour away by car. (The airport is the same distance away.) 

    There are two large conference rooms which both hold seventy people, but there are no smaller seminar rooms for smaller groups. This will be a big problem, because the conference participants will split up into smaller special interest groups to discuss things that are important for them.

    The cost of the venue works out at 1,500 dollars per participant. This includes all meals and entertainment at the night club and other places.

    Hotel Moda in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is a four-star hotel, but it is quite a lot cheaper than the other hotels and there are a lot of things to do and see in Prague.
    
    The hotel is a little older and smaller than the other hotels. But the bedroom are large and there is one conference room and two seminar rooms, so participants will be able to split up into three or more special interest groups.

    Other attractions include a large swimming pool (which is, however, open to the public), a sauna, a hairdressing salon and satellite TV.

    The price of 950 dollar per participant includes meals and two guided tours. Prague is a very interesting old city, so there is a lot to do in it. However the hotel is a half-hour subway ride away from the center of the city, and the hotel, and Prague, generally, is very crowded in summer.

    Hotel Matong, on Tiamon, an island off the east coast of Malaysia, is a five-star hotel with a relaxing atmosphere, but it is a long way to the nearest airport.

    It is quite a large hotel, so there are many large and small conference rooms. People can split up into many small special interest groups. It also has beautiful tropical gardens where you can sit and talk. There is also a golf course, tennis courts, and a soccer field.

    The cost of the venue is 1,350 dollars per participant, including meals. There is perhaps less to do than at the other three hotels, but this may be okay if the purpose of the conference is to discuss business problems.

    The beautiful island setting is peaceful and quiet, so participants may be able to get a lot done. The disadvantage is that it is a long way from the nearest airport. You have to ride a boat to get to the island.

    The Hotel Colossus is a big hotel in Las Vegas, in the U.S. It is the most expensive of the four hotels, but it has the most facilities.

    The five-star hotel looks magnificent and has very big bedrooms, outstanding conference rooms, and many smaller seminar rooms, which however cost extra.

    The price is 1,950 dollars, including meals, and one tour, and each participant gets fifty dollars spending money at the casino which is in the hotel, itself.

    Las Vegas is famous for casinos, but there are many other things that visitors can do in and around Las Vegas. The free use of a car to get to these places is included in the price.

    Of course, the casinos are the big attraction. This may be a disadvantage because the hotel is very, very busy, day and night. It may be difficult to keep tourists out of the conference area, and separate them from participants.

    The airport is close to Las Vegas, so this is one advantage of the venue.

    It's important to have clear goals. Running a business is like taking a trip. Just remember that if you don't know where you want to go, and you go ahead without a plan, it's your fault when you are unhappy about what happens to the business. Choose a structure carefully for your business based on that plan. That structure will determine how the business is run.

    Planning is very, very important. Before talking to people who want to use your service or product, you need to do a lot of planning. But it is also very important to talk to clients. You need to see if you have what they are looking for. If you don't have what they want, perhaps your business plans won't be successful.

    Businesses never stop learning new things. The people who run businesses should never stop learning. Business plans may or may not need to change with that new learning. The hard work that goes into creating a business plan will be repaid again and again, if the plan is constantly held in mind. The plan should not be regarded as a boring thing that you create only because other people, for example, your bank or shareholders, want to see it.

    The plan you have written down can be shown to many different people whenever they want to see a business plan. So the hard work writing down the business plan also should not be regarded as a waste of time. It can be reused many times.

The best business get all the people in the business excited about the plan and make sure everyone feels the company's goals are their personal goals.

    You can't impose a plan on people and expect them to get excited about it and to follow it.  Everyone needs to know what the goal of the company is and to be excited about having a role in reaching that goal. That only happens when everyone feels they themselves are creating the goals of the company and new goals for themselves, at the same time. It doesn't happen when people feel they are just following someone else's goals.

    William Kendall is a successful businessman who became very good at planning ahead. When he owned a business called Covent Garden Soup Company, he found it very difficult to sell it. That was because everyone thought he was a very good businessman. They thought if they bought the company, they wouldn't do as well as him running it. So they thought it would not be a good idea to buy it.

    Therefore, when he started at his next company, Green and Black Chocolates, he immediately started thinking about how to sell it. He went to a very big chocolate company, Cadbury's and asked them if they would like to invest ten percent in the company. They did. And now Cadbury's has bought all of his company. That was his plan.

    William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, so he was learning about the business of food from childhood. He later became a lawyer and a banker and this helped him learn about business practices.

    His wife had also inherited a farm, but she and her family knew nothing about farming. Helping her family running the farm, he learned how to cook. He enjoyed making soup. He thought selling fresh soup would be a good idea. He thought fresh soup would be popular, and he could make a lot of money, because it tastes better than soup in a can.

    A company which also had the idea of selling fresh soup contacted him and he started working there. After some years he became the chief executive of the company, called the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He stayed there for nine years. And sales went from two million pounds to more than twenty million pounds.

    When he saw that the New Covent Garden Soup Company had become successful and there was little for him to do, he decided he wanted to do something else. But it was difficult for him to find someone to buy the business from him. People realized that the company was successful because he was in control. They thought that if someone else took over the company, it wouldn't be as successful as it had been before.

    It took him two years to get a shareholder of the New Covent Garden Soup Company to buy the company. The shareholder was only willing to take over the New Covent Garden Soup Company if William Kendall joined this other company.

    While William Kendall was at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, the company started marketing organic soups, soups made from vegetables grown without any farm chemicals, in addition to soups made from ordinary materials treated with farm chemicals.

    These organic soups were very popular. Kendall realized that lots of people wanted to eat food that was organic and made from natural, unpolluted ingredients. He stopped using farm chemicals on his own farm and with the money he made selling his share of the New Covent Garden Soup Company he bought Green and Black Chocolate from Craig Sams, a very strong supporter of organic foods. Green and Black Chocolate was completely organic. It had no farm chemicals.

    Green and Black Chocolate was very popular with people who only ate organic foods. But Kendall could see that everyone was concerned about healthy food and he believed that Green and Black would become more and more popular in the future.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and that interested him. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    When he took over Green and Black, the company had sales of two million pounds. When the company was sold to a very big chocolate company, six years later, it had sales of twenty-two million pounds.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and he thought that was interesting. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    People who eat organic food feel they are connected to the food because they are eating food which is pure and does not have chemicals added to it. They feel they know this food and the people who grow it better. It feels more like real food.

    When he took over Green and Black, he had to think about what would happen if Green and Black, which was organic, became very popular. Green and Black was already very popular with people who were strong supporters of organic food like its founder, Craig Sams, but not very popular with people who normally didn't think much about organic food. They didn't know about the chocolate, or felt it was different and strange.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    But William Kendall was expecting that everyone would start buying the chocolate. When it became very popular, he thought he would want to sell his share in it and start another business.

    What he did was get Cadbury's, a very big chocolate company, but which does not produce organic chocolate, to buy five percent of the company's shares. Some people said Green and Black should not have a relationship with a non-organic chocolate company. They thought it was a bad idea, but he thought it was a good idea, because small companies like Green and Black need to cooperate with big companies, like Cadbury's, rather than compete with them. He thought if they compete with them, they must lose.

    Only a very big company would be able to buy Green and Black if its chocolates became very popular. And it would be easier for a company with a cooperative relationship with Green and Black to buy it than a company with a competitive relationship.

    Then, in only six years, sales rose from two million pounds to twenty-two million pounds.

    When Cadbury's bought Green and Black, a lot more people who believed in organic food were very unhappy. But William Kendall was very happy, because he had made a lot of money and his plan had worked.

    He had involved a very big company in his business from the start, and they were very willing to take over the business when it made a lot of money.

    Teresa Graham said in the most successful businesses, all the people at the company feel they are part of the plan. Everyone understands what the company is trying to do and everyone believes what they do helps the company achieve its goals.

    She says this is really important and one of the reasons for their success.

    But how do you get everyone in the company to feel that they are an important part of the company's plans? You can't just tell people what the plan is and expect them to follow the plan. If you tell people your plan for your business, Teresa Graham says only some people will follow the plan. The best employees will not follow the plan.

    She says businesses need to involve everyone in the company in the discussion and creation of their plans. She says the way to make sure everyone plays their part in achieving the company's goals is to make sure everyone takes part in creating the plans.

    Everyone needs to understand how what they do helps the company achieve its goals, and everyone needs to have personal goals, which they believe in and are connected to the company's goals. When everyone knows what the company is trying to do, and everyone is excited about helping, the company has lots more power.

    This only happens when people feels they played a a part in developing the company's plans.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    William Kendall has something similar, but different, to say about the role of the company's leaders in managing people. He says the company's owners need to give their managers lots of freedom. He says the company's owners need to find skilled managers and let them do their job the way the managers want to.

    The owners shouldn't be telling their managers how to do their job. The owners have to concentrate on growing the business, and thinking about how the company can develop new plans, not about how people should be carrying out the plans the company has already developed.

    When William Kendall first was a businessman at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, he said they made many mistakes. He said they tried to do everything themselves. Later he said they brought in a group of skilled managers to do marketing, production and administration at the company. This took pressure off the owners and they could spend their time thinking of what the company should do next.

    He says managers should not be given too much freedom, but he also said sometimes too much freedom is better than too little freedom.

    He says at the New Covent Garden Soup Company he learned how to give people a lot of freedom, but not too much freedom. The problem is getting everyone in the business excited about reaching the company's goals and making sure they only do what they are supposed to do to at the same time. The business's employees need to be motivated, but they also need to be controlled.

There is going to be a meeting to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively. The meeting will be run by the Sales Manager (A) and the Deputy Sales Manager (B).
    Relationships: Your team is mainly interested in how much money you can make. You think the company's main aim is to maximize profit.
    Delivery dates: You promise early delivery dates, but the company often cannot meet the dates, and customers complain.
    Reports: You often send in short sales reports which are late and incomplete. And you often forget to send follow-ups when customers place an order.
    Payment system: You are happy with the present system of low basic salary and high commission.
    Sharing information: You are competitive and keep information to yourself, rather than sharing it with co-workers.
    Customer loyalty: You are an aggressive sales person and put pressure on the customers to buy. You often give expensive gifts to customers to buy their loyalty.

    Managers need to understand what motivates people. There are some things that motivate everyone, like, people care about their families, everybody wants to make a difference, everybody wants to be respected. But then, more difficult is understanding how everyone is unique and different. And different to the way that you as a manager think. The secret, therefore is to try to know what the world looks for them, through their eyes, that is, the eyes of another person.
    In order to do that, you need to be good at asking questions and listening to people. You need to ask not just any question, but questions that really tell you about what a person's drivers, or unique motivators are. You need to ask questions to find out what other people are concerned about in this situation that you and they are both in.

    Everything is happening much faster nowadays. We used to be going at fifty kilometers per hour. And now we are going at one hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. People are doing more and trying to do more and more in less and less time. Efficiency is good, but because people are working so hard, they don't have time to think about their goals and what they are trying to achieve. The most important things is to stand back and take a bird's eye view, or the view from a helicopter and see how everything fits into the bigger picture, and to take time to reflect. We don't do enough thinking, reflecting, about what we are trying to do. It's one of the things that get driven out by the time pressure that every one is under. So, standing back and taking the wider view is what I recommend people to do.

    Working with people from other countries can be difficult, because what you think isn't what people from other cultures think. We assume everyone thinks the same way, but that's not true. Normally, we don't even think about the differences in the way people think. Of course, when we do work with people from other countries, we realize they are different and they think differently. But do they think the same thing about us? Do they think we are different, or do they think they are the same as us? 
  
    Actually, the cultural differences, although they're important, are not very big. The real differences are the differences between individual people. Just because everyone from Africa looks the same, that doesn't mean they all think the same. Just because everyone from India looks the same, doesn't mean they all think the same. They're all unique and you need to remember that. Treat everyone as an individual, not according to your understanding of the cultural group.

    Nicole Wilson: I am a woman and I am a manager. My boss always takes my good ideas to the owner of the company and says they are his own, thus getting all the credit. I have decided to resign, because he is stealing my ideas.
    Nigel Nicholson: Women often suffer from this kind of treatment. But look on the bright side: your boss likes your ideas.  It's the credit you're missing.

    What you could do is put your ideas down in writing, and arrange meetings to talk about them with the boss. Say you want to cooperate. Emphasize your desire to collaborate with your boss for the sake of the company. At the meeting, tell him what he could do to support you better and ask him what you could do to support him better. This would give you the opportunity to say that you would like more explicit recognition for your good ideas. But be prepared for your boss to ask you to do more for him.

He is responsible for making the tents and other equipment that your company sells. Todd is your marketing manager. He is responsible for selling your products. The marketing department is very successful, partly because Oliver, one of Todd's sales representatives is a very good salesman. You like both Oliver and Todd. But Oliver and Todd are fighting. You agree Oliver is a difficult employee, but you have been friends with him for years. He is very valuable to the company. You'd like to keep Oliver happy if possible, and to find ways to deal with the situation. The sales from his area amount to twenty-four percent of the business's total sales.

    You are Todd, the marketing manager of the camping equipment company. Oliver is a very good salesman. But he doesn't listen to you. You want Charles to punish Oliver. You tell Charles that Oliver spends too much money on entertainment and expensive gifts for his customers. He also has not introduced you to the biggest buyers in his area. He says the buyers are too busy to meet you. But you think his plan is to leave the company, join a different company and get the buyers to switch to his new company's products. You want to get to know the buyers to make sure that Charles doesn't take his buyers with him. Oliver also ignores your phone messages and does not write sales reports.

    Nigel Nicholson has some advice for managers. It is to listen very carefully and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. This is good advice for the manager of the Muller and Peterson sales teams. The Muller-Peterson sales manager should listen carefully and try to get the two teams to find things they both agree about, like family, respect, and the wish to do a good job. The manager should also talk to members in each team and try to find people in each team who don't agree with the rest of their team, and try to get them to talk to members of the other team.
    Nicholson's advice also applies to Charles, the chief executive of the camping equipment company, where Todd and Oliver are fighting. Charles should talk to Todd and Oliver and find points where they both agree and try to get them to understand each other's ideas and point of view.

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. His advice for Todd, the sales manager at the camping equipment manufacturer, would be to try to understand Oliver better. Todd needs to think about why Oliver wants to be a very good salesman. Todd is American, but Oliver is French. They have many things in common. Do they think differently about marketing because they come from different countries?
    Nigel Nicholson's advice for the manager of the old Peterson sales team, who is now the assistant manager of both teams is to try to understand his (or her) own motivation. The assistant manager thinks the old team has a positive attitude and its efficiency and good customer service is important. Why doesn't he (or she) think the same about the Muller team? Did this person really listen to the ideas of the Muller sales team and ask questions to try to understand them?

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen to people and to ask good questions, so that you can understand their motivation. The Muller sales team and Oliver, the super salesman think similarly. They both think that selling is the most important thing a business does. They both think selling the product is more important than producing the product. So when customers ask for an early delivery date, they both promise early dates, even though they don't know whether the company can deliver by that date. 
    Nicholson advice's to Oliver and the Muller sales team would be to stand back and look at the bigger picture. They need to understand that the company is a system and they need to cooperate with all parts of the system for it to work at its best. And they shouldn't keep information to themselves. They should share it with all the other members of the company so everyone understands the system.

    Nicholson's advice is to stand back and look at the bigger picture. He wants people to realize that what they are doing is part of a system. The Peterson sales team understands it is part of a system. It understands the business is a system where all parts depend on each other. And it understands the company and its customers also form a system. So it thinks it's important to share information with other people in the company. And it realizes that customers will trust the company if they are happy with it. So it tries to build good relationships with customers. 
    But Nicholson wonders if the Peterson sales team understands how important it is to the company. It is perhaps the most important part of the system. It drives the company, because it is the way the company comes in contact with other systems, that is, customers. And the success of the company depends on these contacts with customers.
