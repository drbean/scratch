    What's important, I think, is to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Also, get to know your co-workers and do things with them after work and on the weekends. Get together not just with people in the same office, but with workers in other parts of your company too.

    All this is a lot of work, so you need to have a life outside work. You need to spend time with your family. Have a good time with them, so that you can come back to work feeling good. This will help you do a good job at the company.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Keep that in mind.

    But have your own goals. Your goals are different than your company's goals. Do you want to be doing the same thing for the rest of your career? Think also about what kind of work you want to be doing in the future and think about what you have to do to get that kind of work.

    If you're unhappy with your present job, don't just accept it and keep on working in the job, even though you don't like it. Find ways to make the job a better job in your eyes. If you can't make the job a better job, look for a new job.

    Don't think of your job as something just you do. You are part of a team. Your success depends on what the other people in your team do too. Make sure other people understand that their success depends on what you do too. If they know you are working for them, this will make it easier for you to get them to work for you.

    Be dissatisfied if things are too easy. Prefer to do the difficult thing. Solving a difficult problem, or surviving a difficult situation is very satisfying. But, be prepared for failure and learn from that failure. Try something different and achieve something great.

    It's also important to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Try to better yourself all the time. There is always some skill you can learn for your job and how to do it better. If the company offers you training, take the training. You can study too, part-time at colleges in the evening or weekend, and by reading. Be a life-long learner.

    Talk to your boss. Let management know what you think. If you want something, ask for it. They may not give it to you, but perhaps they will negotiate with you for something less. A raise which is smaller than you wanted is better than no raise at all.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Understand what you are doing.

She has a good knowledge of computing. She has had the best sales results of the Fast-Track Polish sales team in the last five years.

    She speaks Polish and Russian very well. She has a good English vocabulary, but she is not very fluent.

    During the interview, she appeared to have a very strong personality. She was energetic and confident. But sometimes she appeared aggressive. We have doubts whether she will be a good team player.

    Eva is German and aged forty-two. She has a university degree in history. She has worked for over fifteen years as a sales representative in Germany, the U.S. and Poland. She joined Fast-Track a year ago. She has had a good sales record in all her previous jobs. In her first year with Fast-Track, her sales results have been satisfactory.
    She speaks fluent German, English and Polish.
    During the interview, she appeared quiet, but also strong. She was rather nervous at the interview. She might be good at team-building, but would probably be too dependent on other people. She likes administration, but doesn't appear to have many ideas about the future of the company.

    I applied for the job because I think I've got a lot to offer. I'm competitive and I like to win. I know a few people think I'm difficult to work with. Maybe that's true. But I get results. That's the main thing.

    If you choose me, I'll start by improving our sales team. I want people to enjoy working in our sales department. Everyone in the team must help each other, and help me as much as possible. That way, we'll get good results.

    I've got a lot of sales experience, and I've always been successful wherever I've worked, especially during the past year. I think I could lead a team well. I'm the head of our local business club, and I like organizing people and telling them what to do. I'm a very fast learner. I'd enjoy going on a training course to help me do the job better.

    Dr Bean: I tried very hard to motivate the sales team. But frankly they were very poor sales people, and they did a very bad job. I was unable to get them to enjoy selling Fast-Track material, although I tried very hard, setting up various systems to allow them to see the results of their efforts.

    I don't know, perhaps it's because I don't have any sales experience, myself. Or perhaps it was because of my personality. I'm not confident or outgoing. And, although I enjoyed administration of the team, it was very difficult because I don't know any Polish.

  - Thinking about your career--Would you be a good candidate?
  - business
  - all
  - |+
    First, we looked at ways to think about your career. For example, is it important to talk much with the boss about our dreams and ambitions? Should we get together with people in other parts of the company? Next we compared three candidates for a new sales manager position. We had to think whether the candidate would be a good leader and good administrator.

    What is the relationship between these two exercises? The issues are ones that you face together when you think about your position and decide it is not satisfying.

    Companies want new employees who have thought about their career and who have tried to improve it. However in interviews, it is difficult for both interviewer and interviewee to talk about this. Our mental lives are private.

    Sometimes the best candidate will fail to get the job, and a weaker candidate will be chosen. But it is our inner self which finally determines what kind of career we have, rather than the people or society around us.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    To be successful, the website must be easy to find and good to look at. It must have good images and good information, technical information, about the things on sale. There needs to be clear information about prices and special offers. Information about delivery of the products is very important, too. Also the site must be fast and easy to navigate. It must be easy to find things on the site and it must be easy to order the goods and pay for them.

    If you have all these things, then customers will keep coming back.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Not everyone likes buying online, because they don't want to see a picture. They want to see the real thing. Some people feel insecure, handing over their money before getting the item. Other people like the experience of shopping, being seen, entering stores, seeing things and talking to store people.

    Every customer is an individual and different, at the same time as they are all similar. Customers who also like to use websites are also different. And even the same customer is different on different days. Sometimes they will look at the website and then go into a store. Sometimes they will order online.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Argos is a big retailer with many stores all over the U.K. which also has an online operation. It tries to integrate its two different forms of retailing, because its experience is that sometimes a customer will buy online and at other times the same customer will check the website to find information and then go into a store to buy the item. 

    So it has to understand, or try to recognize, what customers want to do on the site while they are still there. It also has to keep prices in its stores the same as prices for the same goods online.

      Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to shop. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

      The Internet is having a big influence on the retail market. Internet retailers can offer cut-throat prices because they do not have to run stores. Websites that publish comparisons of the prices on top online retailers make the market even more competitive.

      Some retailers who sell both online and in stores have tried to handle this problem by charging different prices for goods on their websites and in their stores.

      This dual pricing is becoming harder to practice as customers become better at surfing the Internet. Some people say retailers should integrate their operations so shoppers can buy online and pick up their purchases in stores.

  - IBM advice to online retailers about advocacy--The purpose of the study

    VanTine: Good afternoon. This is Laura VanTine, and today I'll be speaking with Maureen Stancik Boyce, IBM's Institute for Business Values distribution team leader about their IBV study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.  Welcome, Maureen.
    Stancik Boyce: Thanks Laura. I'm excited to talk about our study today, because there's a lot of great information. And I think can really help our clients in this economic environment. 
    VanTine: So let's start out with the general purpose of the study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. The reason we did this study was to get deeper knowledge about consumers who shop online. We conducted a study of US consumers. And it was about twenty-five hundred consumers. We wanted to understand how they feel about their shopping experience. We also wanted to understand how strong is the customer support for their primary online retailer. So they might shop at multiple retailers, but we asked who do you shop at most often. And that's how we defined their primary online retailer.

    We also asked questions about what elements of the online customer experience were most important to the customers. We wanted to understand how well different online retailers were positioned, how good a job they're doing, and offering what the customer wants. And so we kind of ranked the different retailers across each other, how many advocates they do or do not have.

    We also wanted to understand what advocates look like, demographically, what's important to them, stuff like that, and how valuable they are.

    And finally we wanted to understand what actions an online retailer could take in order to gain more advocates.

    VanTine: Can you please explain a little bit more what you mean by advocacy?
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. And that is very important. So advocacy really is defined by three components. The first thing is, likelihood to recommend, the second is purchase intent, and the third is staying rate. And let me define each of those. So the first, likelihood to recommend. That's typical in any kind of CRM, or loyalty study, and that is, would a consumer recommend their primary retailer to family and friends. So that's the first criteria. So IBM has added two others that we feel really help define and show the difference between the casual advocate versus the true advocate.

    The second criteria is purchase intent. And that means a customer's willingness to purchase new products from their primary retailer that they normally buy elsewhere. So an example would be that an online retailer offers only clothes now, and if they started offering accessories, which they can't purchase currently, that they would in fact buy them, accessories, from that same retailer.

    And the third criteria that we used is staying rate. And that means if a new retailer opened up that offered similar products at a similar price point, would the consumer switch to the new retailer or would they stay with the current primary retailer. And if they would stay, they get a check mark in there at staying rate.

    So that anyone who might say yes to two or even one of the three criteria might be defined more as an apathetic. And those who say no to all of the three criteria would certainly be an antagonist, someone who does not like their primary retailer.

  - |+
    VanTine: Why should retailers care so much if their shoppers are advocates or not?
    Stancik Boyce: Well, the key reason truly is financial. Advocates are more valuable customers. Our survey showed that on average, an advocate's share of wallet is actually thirty-three percent higher than the antagonist's. So they spend a lot more money. Advocates spend a lot more money with their primary retailer than do antagonists. Advocates' basket size is also greater. So they spend thirty percent more dollars with their primary retailer than do the antagonists. And then finally advocates are spending more over time. Sixty-five percent of advocates have increased the amount they're purchasing over the past two years. And conversely, there are fewer advocates have decreased their spending over time with their primary retailer, only four percent. The number is higher for antagonists at six percent.

    So in summary, advocates are more valuable becuase they spend a greater percent of their money online, and they spend more than other customers, than the antagonists and the apathetics. And they are increasing their spending over time. So the fact that they spend more and are more loyal, so they stay with their primary retailer longer, really their customer lifetime value is much higher than the average customer.

    VanTine: Since advocates are so valuable, do you have any insights into how retailers can build more advocates. For instance, can you explain what are the factors that drive advocacy and what may be the key areas that are so important to advocates.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. That is actually an important part of our survey that we wanted to understand these factors.

    What we found out is that advocates really find convenience, customer service and the store, quote unquote, experience very important for online retailers. So let me explain a little bit more. What we did is, we asked survey respondents how they feel their primary retailer is doing on a list of statements that we call attributes. So, different parts of the shopping experience. We had a list of fifteen things and we asked the survey respondents, 'Does your primary retailer do this well?'

    That list of fifteen were bucketed into different areas and what we did then is analysis on what advocates were saying versus the apathetics versus the antagonists. And we found that advocates largely agreed that the store are doing things well. It was in the eighty, ninety percentile that they agreed that these attributes were done well by their primary retailer. Conversely, the antagonists and apathetics were much lower. Only twenty, thirty, maybe a couple of situations, forty percent of the antagonists were saying, 'Yes, my retailer does this well.' But what was interesting is that the rank ordering of the things that most people agreed well were in the same order, advocates and antagonists. So we said, Um, these are the most important attributes. It's just that the antagonists are not getting them from their primary retailer.

    So what we found was the absolute top-rated attribute was, 'My online retailer makes it easy to shop.' So that is bucketed into convenience. We said, that's an attribute that really is related to convenience.

    The second highest-rated attribute was, 'I'm happy with the service I receive from online store employees.' So even though a consumer was not in the store, the customer service, when they need help, they want to be able to get help. The consumer wants the help from somebody at the store. Customer service is second in importance.

    And then third we found the statement, 'It was pleasant and enjoyable to shop at this online retailer.' That was the attribute rated third most important.

    You, together with B, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
    You want the website operating within one month. The quicker it is up, the better. But you realize the designer needs time to develop the site.
    You want the website to have lots of information and different links that the user can click.
    You want to pay the designer 6,000 dollars. This seems a reasonable amount of money. You think if you offer less than this, the designer won't be willing to do it, or won't do a good job.
    You want to pay the designer when the site is finished and operating, so you can be sure it works and is acceptable.
    You would like the site to show individual images of all the covers of the books that the bookstore sells. Images are always more interesting than text. They give the reader an idea of what the book is like.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them are not negotiable. You aren't willing to compromise on them. B has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will C and D accept your position?

    You are not concerned about the amount of information on the site just now. You are ready to negotiate the number of pages and links on the site. In fact, any amount is okay.
    You are not willing to pay more than the price A said. It is a fixed price which you can't negotiate.
    You are ready to compromise on when the designer is paid, perhaps some in advance before the designer starts work, and some after the site is up and working.
    A told C and D what Michelle wants in terms of the number of images and the amount of text on the site, but she is willing to compromise on this. She realizes that changes can be made later.
    You don't have to change your position if C and D will accept what A said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which offers will C and D find unacceptable? And will C and D accept your new position?

    You want to limit the amount of information on the website and the different links that the user can click. Michelle probably will want the site redesigned, and a simpler design will make redesigning easier. It will also be quicker to finish a simpler design.
    You want to charge Michelle fifty dollars an hour. This seems a reasonable amount of money. It's the normal fee for the job.
    You want to limit the size of the site. Rather than individual images of all the covers of all the books that the bookstore sells, you want to have bigger images of a few of the popular books. This will mean users don't have to wait so long to see the images.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them may not be negotiable. You may not be willing to compromise on them. D has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will A and B accept your position?

    The designer is willing to incorporate Michelle's ideas into the design of the website, together with your ideas.
    The designer is willing to be paid a fixed price rather than the way A mentioned. But in return, he/she would want half of the fee to be paid in advance, before starting work.
    C told A and B about the problem of images. The designer however is willing to compromise on images, perhaps one or two images of individual covers of books on each page.

    Advertising: It is willing to invest 100,000 dollars less in advertising than the amount C told Lifetime. It is also willing to share advertising costs fifty-fifty.
    Structure: It wants equal management rights to the project. Its intention is to transfer Lifetime's knowledge of the travel market to Direct.
    You don't have to change your position if A and B will accept what C said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which parts of your position will A and B find unacceptable? And will A and B accept your new position?

    Mark: Today's the big day. IKEA is letting me move into their store for a week. First, I need to introduce myself to the people I'm going to live with for the next week--the great employees of IKEA. Now that I'm living here, it's kind of like they're working for me.
    ...
    So everyone I've met here at IKEA so far has been really friendly. The janitor Louis, is very knowledgeable and friendly. If you need any help, (To Louis) I'm happy to mop, or do whatever you want. Nice meeting you.
    Louis: Nice meeting you, too.
    Cashier: I think it's pretty weird. I mean to stay here for six days and, you know, six nights, or whatever. 

    Mark: Right now, we have forty-five minutes until the store opens, so we have to find the bedroom set of my dream. There are hundreds to choose from. But, this has to be the best bedroom set ever. Let's do it. 

    And then I found it. The perfect place for me to crash for the week. Wow! This is it.
    Cool, man. I can make cookies tonight. Wow. Bake pasta. This is awesome. All my cooking needs. A refrigerator. Wow! A bedroom set for the twins I don't have. This place has everything. An apartment like this in New York City would cost three thousand dollars a month.

    Let's see what they have in the wardrobe. Oh, this is cute. Let's see what they left for me. Oh, wow. Well, this is hot. I love that the hanger comes with it. You can't remove the hanger from the clothing. They're based out of Sweden. This must be the latest fashion. This is hot.

    IKEA even gave me some free stuff. The Swedish are the kings of hospitality.
    On behalf of IKEA, we'd like to present you with these gifts, welcoming you into the neighborhood.
    Mark: My gosh. Thank you so much. Um, Scott, I'm going to be here all week. So if you want to hang out, definitely stop by. We'll have a lot of fun. Just, next time you come up, knock. Okay.
    Scott: Okay. I will. Sorry about that.

    Cashier: This's a big building. Lot of places to get lost in.
    Voice-over: It's probably going to take me all week to explore the entire store, but I thought I'd take an after-dinner stroll to look around. But then disaster struck. I was lost in IKEA.
    Mark: Where am I?
    Voice-over: This is the twentieth time I've walked past the sheepskin rug.
    Mark: I can't get home. You have to physically take me to my home. You have to walk me. I'm helpless.
    Voice-over: Thankfully, a friendly IKEA employee returned me safely to my home.
    Mark: My bedroom set! Yo, man. Thank you. Are you okay? Thanks, bro'. I'll talk to you soon.
    Cashier: This's pretty weird.

    Mark's Voice: Testing. Testing. Attention, IKEA customers. The store is now closed. Please bring all purchases to check-out. Some people want to sleep here for crying out loud.
    Mark: This is Thor, the god of Swedish furniture. Please bring your purchases to the front immediately.
    Voice-over: Customers were leaving. Security was locking up. And I realized I could do whatever I wanted. 
    Mark: Yeh! Hi, honey. Oh, not much. It's pretty boring around here. I think I'm probably going to go to bed soon. Oooh. I think my cellphone is going, Ouch. Sssh.

    Look at me. I'm skateboarding past breakables. Caution. Do not enter. It's just a bunch of shopping carts.
    Kind of smells like urine.

    So we found this hidden corridor. No IKEA customers know about it. We're going to explore it. Follow me. Oh, my gosh. It's something I can't pronounce.

    We're here. It's the middle of the night. The only other person than me is Security Guard Jarvis. Thank you for being here.
    Jarvis: You're welcome.
    Mark: I'm going to be staying here in the middle of the night. Does it get scary?
    Jarvis: It does. It does get scary. After midnight, all the lights shut off. And then we start hearing squeaks and sounds and whistlings. If I was you, I would like to stay in the light. Care to go play ...

  - Uniqlo's marketing mix

    Uniqlo is a Japanese clothing brand. It started as a small suit maker in 1963 and is now one of the biggest Japanese clothing companies.

    Uniqlo's name has always been connected to the Japanese music scene. Its customers are young and fashionable.

    Uniqlo has developed a unique marketing mix. It has the right combination of product, price, promotion and place.

    If a clothes company wants to be successful, it needs to have the right marketing mix. Every company has a different marketing mix of product, price, promotion and place.

    The product is what Uniqlo sells. The price is how much the customer pays. Promotion is what Uniqlo does to keep Uniqlo in customers' minds. Place is where and how the customer buys Uniqlo clothes.

    The company has to make the right decisions about all of product, price, promotion and place to make the most money. And decisions about each of these things affects decisions about the other things.

    Uniqlo has to design clothes and see if customers like them. But, it also has to know what clothes will be popular in the next six months, in spring or fall, and produce those kind of clothes.

    In the fashion industry, clothes are only fashionable for a short time. Uniqlo has to change the style of its clothes all the time.

    New styles are developed for the spring and fall season. But when one style of clothes is becoming popular, small changes are continually made in the style to keep it popular.

    If these continual small changes are not made, the style can quickly lose popularity.

    Uniqlo has to look at its customers and decide how much they are willing to pay. It also has to decide how much it costs to produce its clothes.

    Uniqlo products are medium-priced. People are willing to pay a little more for them to show they are successful.

    It is not low-priced. The clothes of people who buy low-priced brands show they want value for the price they pay.

    It is not high-priced. People who buy a high-priced brand will buy it, even if it is cheaper, or even if it is more expensive. They want to show they have clothes which are different or the latest style.

    Place is where Uniqlo products may be bought and also the ways the clothes are delivered or distributed to these places.

    Uniqlo controls very carefully the places where its clothes may be bought. It has its own stores, and it has places in department stores, where the customer feels they are in a special Uniqlo store.

    It wants to create an environment where the customer has a unique Uniqlo experience. If people can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere, they don't have that special Uniqlo experience.

    And people will think the Uniqlo brand is less fashionable if they can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere.

    The purpose of promotion is to get customers. Promotion includes advertising in magazines or on TV, and mailing of catalogs and newsletters to customers. It also includes getting famous people to wear Uniqlo clothes, the way Michael Jordan endorsed Nike shoes.

    Japanese rappers Scha Dara Parr wear Uniqlo clothes. They are paid by Uniqlo to endorse the brand.

    Other forms of promotion include discounts, give-away competitions, and participation in public events.

    Promotion also includes the style of its public image, that is, the look of Uniqlo stores, Uniqlo displays, Uniqlo packaging and the Uniqlo logo 

    All these things have an effect on sales of Uniqlo clothes.

    January 19, 2009. Where marketers are today:

    For those who have studied marketing, you’ll recall the 4 P’s:, Product, Price, Placement and Promotion.

  - Who manages the 4 P's?

  - B
  - |+
 
    Today, however, three out of four of those P’s have often been usurped by other parts of the organization. Product is often managed by a research and development, or product development, group. Price is often set by the sales team, or in some cases by customers. Placement is within the purview of the distribution arm, which leaves marketers with Promotion.

    Now, Promotion is often interpreted by other departments as "making it pretty" or is at the service of the sales organization.

    To make matters worse, organizations are siloed so these different internal organs are not well coordinated or even on the same page. With increasing pressure to demonstrate ROI metrics around Promotion, marketers are less empowered and less able to bring value to their organizations.
    
    At the same time, the context in which they are operating has become far more complex. New technologies offer new communication channels, and has changed the dynamics of communication.

    Managing the marketing mix, and optimizing it, is increasingly complex. Many traditional marketers not only don’t get the new context, but they are still trying to apply a broadcast framework when they need to adopt a conversational one. This reality has degraded marketing’s reputation within organizations. And, that said, we need marketing more than ever at this moment, and I believe it can bring significant value to these companies.

    First and foremost, marketing needs to be ....

    So many people are losing their jobs. I am afraid I will be next. Because we work in the Human Resources department, we are responsible for firing the people. Now it is our turn to be fired.

    It would be okay if there were less work to do, but with fewer and fewer people here now, there is more and more work to do.

    We are under a lot of pressure and there is never enough time to do a good job. I will be glad when I'm fired. The stress is killing me.

    I just can't cope any more.

    My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable. Everything that doesn't go according to management's plan is my fault or someone else's fault, management says.

    That would be okay if I felt like what I did had an effect. But I don't feel like I have any control over what is happening. Nothing I do seems to work. I am very confused. I don't understand the situration. I don't know what's happening. It's a very stressful situation.

    I feel like I am falling off a cliff. I can't take it any more.

    My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable.

    It would also be okay if I had some freedom to make my own decisions. But none of us are allowed to think for ourselves. Management is always telling us what to do. Everything we do is monitored. We are expected to follow orders blindly.

    And management never tells us we are doing a good job. We are only blamed when it is unhappy. It doesn't care if we are happy or not.

    I feel like I am about to explode. I can't take it any more.

    I am really unhappy with our manager. She never listens to what we say. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.'

    When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.'

    She also never tells us what management's plans are. If she told us more, we would feel less stress.

    Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault. 

    We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.

    BDL: I think the best thing to improve the health and well-being of our staff is to improve the food in the company cafeteria. Generally, the food here isn't healthy. If someone just ate the food available in the company cafeteria, they wouldn't be getting a balanced diet. There is too much fatty, salty, starchy and sweet food, and not enough fish, fruit and vegetables.

    And the food here is not good for people's stress levels. You know how drinking coffee or coke can make you feel more tense and excited? That's stress. And research has shown that fatty, salty, starchy and sweet foods also raise people's stress levels.

    To reduce these levels, we need to have more natural foods, like fish, fruit and vegetables, in the cafeteria. Perhaps they don't taste so good as the food we have now, but people will feel more relaxed and will live better lives.

    SLT: To reduce stress here at the company, I think it's important that everyone be involved in a lot of physical activity, like jogging, or swimming, or basketball.

    It would be nice to have our own basketball court and swimming pool, but that would be very expensive.

    Instead, I think we should talk to the manager of the local sports center and arrange a group membership for everyone at the company. That would probably also be expensive, but the sports center has a good pool and a sauna.

    I think a lot of workers would enjoy a swim at lunch time or after work. The sauna is also very relaxing.

    And I'm sure their basketball court would be very popular. Even now, many people here are members of the sports center, and they use the basketball court during the lunch hour or after work.

    They also have a weight room, where people can use exercise machines.

    KED: I think, to improve everyone's well-being and reduce stress at the company, we should have company tours. Every month, we should all go in buses to an amusement park, or climb a mountain and have a picnic.

    Once or twice a year, we should travel to some place of interest, here or overseas, and spend a few days together seeing scenic spots, and having fun.

    As an example, I think it would be fun and relaxing for everyone in the company to go to Korea and go shopping and eat Korean food, and bring back some Korean souvenirs.

    In winter, we could go skiing there. In summer, it would be nice too, because it would be a lot cooler than Taiwan.

    When people are having fun, they can forget about work, and they will come back with good feelings about the company.

    So, my idea is one-day company tours, once a month, and three- or four- day tours, once or twice a year.

    Stress doesn't usually have only one cause. Usually, there are a number of factors which together result in people feeling stress. A particularly bad combination is where someone is under a lot of pressure, but they also feel that whatever they do has no effect and that they have no support from other people. That combination can cause severe stress and depression. People in that situation often feel helpless. And that's a very bad feeling.

    Bradshaw is a business consultant, and he has a consultancy called In Equilibrium. He helps companies where stress is a problem by identifying the causes of high levels of stress there. He calls this stress risk assessment. The idea is to identify hotspots, areas or people where the risk of stress is high. Perhaps there is a dangerous and unpleasant environment in one part of the company. Or perhaps one manager puts a lot of pressure on workers.

    Besides helping companies understand why there is lots of stress at their companies, Bradshaw also trains managers to do the same kind of thing as he does. He shows them how to become more sensitive to how much stress there is in the company. He teaches them how to listen carefully to their workers. He also gives them the skills to reduce stress. He shows them how different ways of managing workers produce different levels of stress.

    Men and women deal with stress differently. Women tend to report more stress. They talk about their problems. Men don't do this. Women usually cope with stress better. They're better at asking for and and getting support. 

    Men don't like to report stress, because they don't want to appear weak. They don't want people to think they can't do their job. Actually, they are worse at coping with stress. They find it difficult to talk to managers about stress.

    A good working climate is one where stress is largely prevented. With this in mind and in the next three minutes, I would like to provide a brief overview of a critically-important In Equilibrium framework, called the CUSP. The CUSP can be used both to prevent stress and to reduce the risks to an individual's health ...

    when stress has occurred. The CUSP really is a very useful model, and is based on what we know from thousands of psychological studies and from experience.

    We know that stressful situations, especially those at work, have particular characteristics. Stressful situations tend to be where individuals feel that they have very little control over what is happening.

    They're often high in uncertainty. And they tend to be situations where individuals feel unsupported, or feel that they are receiving the wrong kind of support.

    The way the CUSP works is very simple. The framework suggests that as a manager, if you can do anything to boost someone's sense of control, if you can ...

    ... reduce the level of uncertainty in the situation, or if you can offer support, either directly or facilitated from elsewhere, then that will tend to reduce the level of the pressure impacting on stress risk.

    Hence, the 'C' stands for Control. The 'U' for Uncertainty, the 'S' for Support, and the 'P' for Pressure.

    Max: It's certainly got to have a spacious conference room.
    Alex: Absolutely! We're expecting over seventy delegates, so we'll definitely need a large conference room. In addition, let's not forget that at times, the participants will have to split up into special interest groups, so we'll need access to a number of seminar rooms as well. How many do you reckon?

    The Long Beach Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco is a five-star hotel on the beach, so it is very nice, but there is not much to do in the area around the hotel. 
    
    It has a lot of nice facilities, like a large swimming pool and a sauna, and a very large tropical garden where you can sit and eat and drink. It also has shops and a good nightclub where you can have fun in the evening.

    But there is not much you can do when you go outside the hotel. The town is one hour away by car. (The airport is the same distance away.) 

    There are two large conference rooms which both hold seventy people, but there are no smaller seminar rooms for smaller groups. This will be a big problem, because the conference participants will split up into smaller special interest groups to discuss things that are important for them.

    The cost of the venue works out at 1,500 dollars per participant. This includes all meals and entertainment at the night club and other places.

    Hotel Moda in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is a four-star hotel, but it is quite a lot cheaper than the other hotels and there are a lot of things to do and see in Prague.
    
    The hotel is a little older and smaller than the other hotels. But the bedroom are large and there is one conference room and two seminar rooms, so participants will be able to split up into three or more special interest groups.

    Other attractions include a large swimming pool (which is, however, open to the public), a sauna, a hairdressing salon and satellite TV.

    The price of 950 dollar per participant includes meals and two guided tours. Prague is a very interesting old city, so there is a lot to do in it. However the hotel is a half-hour subway ride away from the center of the city, and the hotel, and Prague, generally, is very crowded in summer.

    Hotel Matong, on Tiamon, an island off the east coast of Malaysia, is a five-star hotel with a relaxing atmosphere, but it is a long way to the nearest airport.

    It is quite a large hotel, so there are many large and small conference rooms. People can split up into many small special interest groups. It also has beautiful tropical gardens where you can sit and talk. There is also a golf course, tennis courts, and a soccer field.

    The cost of the venue is 1,350 dollars per participant, including meals. There is perhaps less to do than at the other three hotels, but this may be okay if the purpose of the conference is to discuss business problems.

    The beautiful island setting is peaceful and quiet, so participants may be able to get a lot done. The disadvantage is that it is a long way from the nearest airport. You have to ride a boat to get to the island.

    The Hotel Colossus is a big hotel in Las Vegas, in the U.S. It is the most expensive of the four hotels, but it has the most facilities.

    The five-star hotel looks magnificent and has very big bedrooms, outstanding conference rooms, and many smaller seminar rooms, which however cost extra.

    The price is 1,950 dollars, including meals, and one tour, and each participant gets fifty dollars spending money at the casino which is in the hotel, itself.

    Las Vegas is famous for casinos, but there are many other things that visitors can do in and around Las Vegas. The free use of a car to get to these places is included in the price.

    Of course, the casinos are the big attraction. This may be a disadvantage because the hotel is very, very busy, day and night. It may be difficult to keep tourists out of the conference area, and separate them from participants.

    The airport is close to Las Vegas, so this is one advantage of the venue.

    It's important to have clear goals. Running a business is like taking a trip. Just remember that if you don't know where you want to go, and you go ahead without a plan, it's your fault when you are unhappy about what happens to the business. Choose a structure carefully for your business based on that plan. That structure will determine how the business is run.

    Planning is very, very important. Before talking to people who want to use your service or product, you need to do a lot of planning. But it is also very important to talk to clients. You need to see if you have what they are looking for. If you don't have what they want, perhaps your business plans won't be successful.

    Businesses never stop learning new things. The people who run businesses should never stop learning. Business plans may or may not need to change with that new learning. The hard work that goes into creating a business plan will be repaid again and again, if the plan is constantly held in mind. The plan should not be regarded as a boring thing that you create only because other people, for example, your bank or shareholders, want to see it.

    The plan you have written down can be shown to many different people whenever they want to see a business plan. So the hard work writing down the business plan also should not be regarded as a waste of time. It can be reused many times.

    Businesses which grow fast always have good plans and good business planning processes. This has been identified as one of the main reasons for their success. The best business get all the people in the business excited about the plan and make sure everyone feels the company's goals are their personal goals.

    You can't impose a plan on people and expect them to get excited about it and to follow it.  Everyone needs to know what the goal of the company is and to be excited about having a role in reaching that goal. That only happens when everyone feels they themselves are creating the goals of the company and new goals for themselves, at the same time. It doesn't happen when people feel they are just following someone else's goals.

    William Kendall is a successful businessman who became very good at planning ahead. When he owned a business called Covent Garden Soup Company, he found it very difficult to sell it. That was because everyone thought he was a very good businessman. They thought if they bought the company, they wouldn't do as well as him running it. So they thought it would not be a good idea to buy it.

    Therefore, when he started at his next company, Green and Black Chocolates, he immediately started thinking about how to sell it. He went to a very big chocolate company, Cadbury's and asked them if they would like to invest ten percent in the company. They did. And now Cadbury's has bought all of his company. That was his plan.

    Organic food is food grown without the use of farm chemicals. There have always been people who believe in organic food and food which is different than the food other people eat. But the numbers of these people were very small and organic farmers, organic food producers and organic restaurants never made much money.
    Now, however, people like William Kendall and Craig Sams have made a lot of money by selling organic products. Kendall thinks many people with money have becoming dissatisfied with the cheap, packaged food they can buy in supermarkets. They want a closer connection with the production of the food they eat, and they are prepared to pay more for it.

    William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, but he studied law in college and worked as a lawyer and banker, before becoming a businessman. However, at this time, his wife inherited a farm, so he became involved in farming again, although not organic farming. He didn't believe in organic food.
    But he found that the organic products his first company made became very popular. He was very successful with this first company, which marketed fresh soup in a carton, rather than in a can or packet. He changed his views about organic food and he made his own farm an organic farm. 
    Then he took over Craig Sams' organic chocolate company, and he was even more successful.

    Craig Sams is a businessman who is older than William Kendall. His first business was an organic restaurant. He has always had extreme ideas about what food is good for you. His products never had sugar in them. He thinks tomatoes are not good for you. Then he started producing organic chocolate, which is thirty-percent sugar.
    His chocolate became very, very popular. All of the most popular natural food products sold in America are chocolate. But he didn't have the financial resources to build the company fast enough. William Kendall offered to buy a seventy-five-percent share in the company, and the company grew fifty percent each year.
    Now everybody eats some of Sams' chocolate.

    Prince Charles is the son of Queen Elizabeth and will be the next king of England. Everyone thought he was mad twenty to thirty years ago, when he bought a farm and started talking to the vegetables. Then, five years later, he made the farm completely organic. But, now his farm and its products make fifty million pounds a year.
    More and more people started believing in organic food. The organic food market is now worth two billion pounds each year in England. William Kendall was one of the farmers who went to the Prince's farm and learned about organic farming.
    Now William Kendall's own farm is run the same way as the Prince's, without agricultural chemicals.

    William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, so he was learning about the business of food from childhood. He later became a lawyer and a banker and this helped him learn about business practices.

    His wife had also inherited a farm, but she and her family knew nothing about farming. Helping her family running the farm, he learned how to cook. He enjoyed making soup. He thought selling fresh soup would be a good idea. He thought fresh soup would be popular, and he could make a lot of money, because it tastes better than soup in a can.

    A company which also had the idea of selling fresh soup contacted him and he started working there. After some years he became the chief executive of the company, called the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He stayed there for nine years. And sales went from two million pounds to more than twenty million pounds.

    When he saw that the New Covent Garden Soup Company had become successful and there was little for him to do, he decided he wanted to do something else. But it was difficult for him to find someone to buy the business from him. People realized that the company was successful because he was in control. They thought that if someone else took over the company, it wouldn't be as successful as it had been before.

    It took him two years to get a shareholder of the New Covent Garden Soup Company to buy the company. The shareholder was only willing to take over the New Covent Garden Soup Company if William Kendall joined this other company.

    While William Kendall was at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, the company started marketing organic soups, soups made from vegetables grown without any farm chemicals, in addition to soups made from ordinary materials treated with farm chemicals.

    These organic soups were very popular. Kendall realized that lots of people wanted to eat food that was organic and made from natural, unpolluted ingredients. He stopped using farm chemicals on his own farm and with the money he made selling his share of the New Covent Garden Soup Company he bought Green and Black Chocolate from Craig Sams, a very strong supporter of organic foods. Green and Black Chocolate was completely organic. It had no farm chemicals.

    Green and Black Chocolate was very popular with people who only ate organic foods. But Kendall could see that everyone was concerned about healthy food and he believed that Green and Black would become more and more popular in the future.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and that interested him. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    When he took over Green and Black, the company had sales of two million pounds. When the company was sold to a very big chocolate company, six years later, it had sales of twenty-two million pounds.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and he thought that was interesting. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    People who eat organic food feel they are connected to the food because they are eating food which is pure and does not have chemicals added to it. They feel they know this food and the people who grow it better. It feels more like real food.

    When he took over Green and Black, he had to think about what would happen if Green and Black, which was organic, became very popular. Green and Black was already very popular with people who were strong supporters of organic food like its founder, Craig Sams, but not very popular with people who normally didn't think much about organic food. They didn't know about the chocolate, or felt it was different and strange.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    But William Kendall was expecting that everyone would start buying the chocolate. When it became very popular, he thought he would want to sell his share in it and start another business.

    What he did was get Cadbury's, a very big chocolate company, but which does not produce organic chocolate, to buy five percent of the company's shares. Some people said Green and Black should not have a relationship with a non-organic chocolate company. They thought it was a bad idea, but he thought it was a good idea, because small companies like Green and Black need to cooperate with big companies, like Cadbury's, rather than compete with them. He thought if they compete with them, they must lose.

    Only a very big company would be able to buy Green and Black if its chocolates became very popular. And it would be easier for a company with a cooperative relationship with Green and Black to buy it than a company with a competitive relationship.

    Then, in only six years, sales rose from two million pounds to twenty-two million pounds.

    When Cadbury's bought Green and Black, a lot more people who believed in organic food were very unhappy. But William Kendall was very happy, because he had made a lot of money and his plan had worked.

    He had involved a very big company in his business from the start, and they were very willing to take over the business when it made a lot of money.

    Teresa Graham said in the most successful businesses, all the people at the company feel they are part of the plan. Everyone understands what the company is trying to do and everyone believes what they do helps the company achieve its goals.

    She says this is really important and one of the reasons for their success.

    But how do you get everyone in the company to feel that they are an important part of the company's plans? You can't just tell people what the plan is and expect them to follow the plan. If you tell people your plan for your business, Teresa Graham says only some people will follow the plan. The best employees will not follow the plan.

    She says businesses need to involve everyone in the company in the discussion and creation of their plans. She says the way to make sure everyone plays their part in achieving the company's goals is to make sure everyone takes part in creating the plans.

    Everyone needs to understand how what they do helps the company achieve its goals, and everyone needs to have personal goals, which they believe in and are connected to the company's goals. When everyone knows what the company is trying to do, and everyone is excited about helping, the company has lots more power.

    This only happens when people feels they played a a part in developing the company's plans.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    William Kendall has something similar, but different, to say about the role of the company's leaders in managing people. He says the company's owners need to give their managers lots of freedom. He says the company's owners need to find skilled managers and let them do their job the way the managers want to.

    The owners shouldn't be telling their managers how to do their job. The owners have to concentrate on growing the business, and thinking about how the company can develop new plans, not about how people should be carrying out the plans the company has already developed.

    When William Kendall first was a businessman at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, he said they made many mistakes. He said they tried to do everything themselves. Later he said they brought in a group of skilled managers to do marketing, production and administration at the company. This took pressure off the owners and they could spend their time thinking of what the company should do next.

    He says managers should not be given too much freedom, but he also said sometimes too much freedom is better than too little freedom.

    He says at the New Covent Garden Soup Company he learned how to give people a lot of freedom, but not too much freedom. The problem is getting everyone in the business excited about reaching the company's goals and making sure they only do what they are supposed to do to at the same time. The business's employees need to be motivated, but they also need to be controlled.

    I think I am getting better at planning. But I don't know what to do to reach my goal. Kendall had a good idea, or could recognize good ideas before other people recognized them. Google had a good idea. I have good ideas but I cannot turn them into things people want to do.

    Bean: One goal is to get the students to speak English rather than Chinese.

If they realize this, they might decide to use English there rather than Chinese, because their partner doesn't understand English well. It will confuse their partner.

You will lead the meeting with the support of B, the Deputy Sales Manager. It is your job to listen to the sales people's opinions and to agree on a plan which will improve the atmosphere in the department and help staff to work together more effectively.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: In fact, you are impressed by the Muller sales representatives. You think they are better sales people than the Peterson ones. You think their ambition and energy are good for the company. They also make more money for the company.

  - |+
    A year ago, two marine equipment manufacturers, Muller and Peterson joined to form a large company, MPM. The Muller and Peterson sales teams were put together, and the Muller Sales Manager, that is, A, became Sales Manager of the new team and Peterson's Sales Manager, that is, you, became Deputy Sales Manager.
    The ideas of the two sales teams were very different. A meeting is going to be held to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively. A, as Sales Manager, will lead the meeting, and you, as Deputy Sales Manager, will help him/her.  It is your job to listen to the sales people's opinions and to agree on a plan which will improve the atmosphere in the department and help staff to work together more effectively.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: In fact, you are impressed more by the Peterson sales representatives. You think they have a more positive attitude. You think their efficiency and good customer service are important for the future success of the company.

    You are a member of the Muller sales team which has been joined with the Peterson sales team in a new company, MPM. The other team was very different. There is going to be a meeting to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively. The meeting will be run by the Sales Manager (A) and the Deputy Sales Manager (B).
    Relationships: Your team is mainly interested in how much money you can make. You think the company's main aim is to maximize profit.
    Delivery dates: You promise early delivery dates, but the company often cannot meet the dates, and customers complain.
    Reports: You often send in short sales reports which are late and incomplete. And you often forget to send follow-ups when customers place an order.
    Payment system: You are happy with the present system of low basic salary and high commission.
    Sharing information: You are competitive and keep information to yourself, rather than sharing it with co-workers.
    Customer loyalty: You are an aggressive sales person and put pressure on the customers to buy. You often give expensive gifts to customers to buy their loyalty.

    Relationships: Your team is interested in working as a team, not how much money you make. You think the company's main aim is to keep the customer happy. Then it will make a profit.
    Delivery dates: You believe the company should always meet its delivery dates. So you don't promise early delivery dates.
    Reports: You always send in good, informative sales reports before the deadline. And you always send follow-ups when customers place an order.
    Payment system: You would like a higher basic salary and bonuses if you exceed the monthly target.
    Sharing information: You believe staff should share information about customers to maximize sales.
    Customer loyalty: You do not put pressure on the customers to buy. You do not give expensive gifts to customers. You build loyalty by gaining their trust.

    Managers need to understand what motivates people. There are some things that motivate everyone, like, people care about their families, everybody wants to make a difference, everybody wants to be respected. But then, more difficult is understanding how everyone is unique and different. And different to the way that you as a manager think. The secret, therefore is to try to know what the world looks for them, through their eyes, that is, the eyes of another person.
    In order to do that, you need to be good at asking questions and listening to people. You need to ask not just any question, but questions that really tell you about what a person's drivers, or unique motivators are. You need to ask questions to find out what other people are concerned about in this situation that you and they are both in.

    Everything is happening much faster nowadays. We used to be going at fifty kilometers per hour. And now we are going at one hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. People are doing more and trying to do more and more in less and less time. Efficiency is good, but because people are working so hard, they don't have time to think about their goals and what they are trying to achieve. The most important things is to stand back and take a bird's eye view, or the view from a helicopter and see how everything fits into the bigger picture, and to take time to reflect. We don't do enough thinking, reflecting, about what we are trying to do. It's one of the things that get driven out by the time pressure that every one is under. So, standing back and taking the wider view is what I recommend people to do.

    Working with people from other countries can be difficult, because what you think isn't what people from other cultures think. We assume everyone thinks the same way, but that's not true. Normally, we don't even think about the differences in the way people think. Of course, when we do work with people from other countries, we realize they are different and they think differently. But do they think the same thing about us? Do they think we are different, or do they think they are the same as us? 
  
    Actually, the cultural differences, although they're important, are not very big. The real differences are the differences between individual people. Just because everyone from Africa looks the same, that doesn't mean they all think the same. Just because everyone from India looks the same, doesn't mean they all think the same. They're all unique and you need to remember that. Treat everyone as an individual, not according to your understanding of the cultural group.

    Nicole Wilson: I am a woman and I am a manager. My boss always takes my good ideas to the owner of the company and says they are his own, thus getting all the credit. I have decided to resign, because he is stealing my ideas.
    Nigel Nicholson: Women often suffer from this kind of treatment. But look on the bright side: your boss likes your ideas.  It's the credit you're missing.

    What you could do is put your ideas down in writing, and arrange meetings to talk about them with the boss. Say you want to cooperate. Emphasize your desire to collaborate with your boss for the sake of the company. At the meeting, tell him what he could do to support you better and ask him what you could do to support him better. This would give you the opportunity to say that you would like more explicit recognition for your good ideas. But be prepared for your boss to ask you to do more for him.

    You are Charles, the chief executive of a camping equipment company in France. Jacques is your production manager. He is responsible for making the tents and other equipment that your company sells. Todd is your marketing manager. He is responsible for selling your products. The marketing department is very successful, partly because Oliver, one of Todd's sales representatives is a very good salesman. You like both Oliver and Todd. But Oliver and Todd are fighting. You agree Oliver is a difficult employee, but you have been friends with him for years. He is very valuable to the company. You'd like to keep Oliver happy if possible, and to find ways to deal with the situation. The sales from his area amount to twenty-four percent of the business's total sales.

    Todd: Really? What exactly is the problem?
    Oliver: I think you know it, Todd. Jacques let me down badly with that order. He just wouldn't make any effort for me, so we've lost the order. It means I don't get the commission, and it'll also affect my bonus.
    Todd: Oliver, you must understand. You can't promise a customer that we'll deliver in three weeks. It's a busy time at the moment. Jacques's working under a lot of pressure.
    Oliver: Maybe, but let's face it. Jacques's no good as a production manager. He can't deal with pressure. He just says, Sorry I can't help. But it's not just Jacques..
    Todd: Oh yes?

    You are Todd, the marketing manager of the camping equipment company. Oliver is a very good salesman. But he doesn't listen to you. You want Charles to punish Oliver. You tell Charles that Oliver spends too much money on entertainment and expensive gifts for his customers. He also has not introduced you to the biggest buyers in his area. He says the buyers are too busy to meet you. But you think his plan is to leave the company, join a different company and get the buyers to switch to his new company's products. You want to get to know the buyers to make sure that Charles doesn't take his buyers with him. Oliver also ignores your phone messages and does not write sales reports.

    On Friday, last week, Charles, C.E.O. of the camping goods company, told Olivier it was okay to accept a large order from Carrefour for camping goods, The goods had to be delivered in two weeks. Charles knows that it is almost impossible for his company to deliver the goods. But he wants the money.

    When Jacques, the Production Manager, heard about the Carrefour order, he complained to the Sales Department. He told Todd that he cannot produce the goods in two weeks, because now is the busiest time of the year for the production department. He asked Todd who okayed the order.

    Olivier is the Sales Department's best salesman. He is very sorry for Jacques because the Production Department cannot handle the Carrefour order. Charles, the C.E.O., is Olivier's friend, and he asked Olivier to take the order. Olivier is under a lot of pressure from Charles to increase sales.

    Todd, the Sales Manager, asked Olivier why he took the order from Carrefour. Todd knows the Production Department is very busy now. Olivier tells him Charles told him it was okay to take the order. Todd is unhappy Olivier did not ask him. He is also mad at Charles for okaying the order. He wonders what he should tell Carrefour.

    On Friday, last week, Charles, CEO of the camping goods company, found that the production department was working on a large order from Carrefour for camping goods, This surprised him because the company had never before produced goods for Carrefour. He asked Todd, his sales manager to investigate.

    Todd asked Jacques about the large Carrefour order. Jacques said he didn't know anything. He said perhaps Olivier got the Carrefour order. Todd told Jacques that it wasn't Olivier's order. Jacques then asked Todd not to tell Charles. He said he would give Todd half the money that Carrefour was paying him for the goods.

    Todd asked Olivier about the Carrefour order Jacques was working on. Olivier said that Charles had already talked to him about it. He said he was as surprised and as unhappy as Charles. He said that he had taken Carrefour buyers to dinner and had bought them presents many times, but they had never given him one order. 

    Upset by the news, Todd told Charles it was impossible that he not know about orders that the production department was working on. He told Charles that either Olivier or Jacques must be stealing from the company. He asked Olivier. Olivier was as mad as him. Todd decided Jacques was the bad man.

He doesn't like working in an office. He likes to go out and have fun with buyers and try to get their orders.

    Because Olivier wouldn't be marketing manager, you gave Todd the job. He knows a lot about sales and marketing. But he has a bad relationship with Olivier. You think you might fire Todd, because Olivier is your friend and the company's best sales representative.

    Sometimes you have a bad relationship with Olivier, but it is not always bad. Usually it is good. It is only bad when he has an important order you can't work on. A lot of the orders you produce in the Production Department come from Olivier, so you see him a lot. Olivier never says bad things to you about Todd.

    But you know Olivier and Todd don't have a good relationship with each other. When you have a problem, you go to see Todd. Then Todd always says bad things to you about Olivier. You know Todd is jealous of Olivier's sales ability.

    You don't like Olivier. You are his boss, but he makes more money than you do, because he is a super-salesman. The company pays him twenty percent of the money it makes from each order. So he makes a lot of money.
    
    You are jealous of his ability as a salesman. You try to prevent him selling so much by not giving him any freedom. You criticize him for his car accident and for his entertainment expenses. You ask him to to go to unnecessary meetings, write unnecessary reports and telephone you all the time. You want him to leave the company.

    Nigel Nicholson has some advice for managers. It is to listen very carefully and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. This is good advice for the manager of the Muller and Peterson sales teams. The Muller-Peterson sales manager should listen carefully and try to get the two teams to find things they both agree about, like family, respect, and the wish to do a good job. The manager should also talk to members in each team and try to find people in each team who don't agree with the rest of their team, and try to get them to talk to members of the other team.
    Nicholson's advice also applies to Charles, the chief executive of the camping equipment company, where Todd and Oliver are fighting. Charles should talk to Todd and Oliver and find points where they both agree and try to get them to understand each other's ideas and point of view.

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. His advice for Todd, the sales manager at the camping equipment manufacturer, would be to try to understand Oliver better. Todd needs to think about why Oliver wants to be a very good salesman. Todd is American, but Oliver is French. They have many things in common. Do they think differently about marketing because they come from different countries?
    Nigel Nicholson's advice for the manager of the old Peterson sales team, who is now the assistant manager of both teams is to try to understand his (or her) own motivation. The assistant manager thinks the old team has a positive attitude and its efficiency and good customer service is important. Why doesn't he (or she) think the same about the Muller team? Did this person really listen to the ideas of the Muller sales team and ask questions to try to understand them?

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen to people and to ask good questions, so that you can understand their motivation. The Muller sales team and Oliver, the super salesman think similarly. They both think that selling is the most important thing a business does. They both think selling the product is more important than producing the product. So when customers ask for an early delivery date, they both promise early dates, even though they don't know whether the company can deliver by that date. 
    Nicholson advice's to Oliver and the Muller sales team would be to stand back and look at the bigger picture. They need to understand that the company is a system and they need to cooperate with all parts of the system for it to work at its best. And they shouldn't keep information to themselves. They should share it with all the other members of the company so everyone understands the system.

    Nicholson's advice is to stand back and look at the bigger picture. He wants people to realize that what they are doing is part of a system. The Peterson sales team understands it is part of a system. It understands the business is a system where all parts depend on each other. And it understands the company and its customers also form a system. So it thinks it's important to share information with other people in the company. And it realizes that customers will trust the company if they are happy with it. So it tries to build good relationships with customers. 
    But Nicholson wonders if the Peterson sales team understands how important it is to the company. It is perhaps the most important part of the system. It drives the company, because it is the way the company comes in contact with other systems, that is, customers. And the success of the company depends on these contacts with customers.

    00:34 Interviewer: Anthony, when starting up a new business, how do you work out how much money you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: That's a very good question. Initially you need to look at the start up costs, as distinct to the running costs.  Because obviously when a business is first formed, there are a number of costs to get the thing going. For example, are you going to work from home? Are you going to have business premises? Do you need equipment? Have you got to buy stock? And all of these issues are very important before you even get going.

    There are hidden costs of course, which sometimes people forget when they're starting running a business. For example legal expenses, if you're setting up, if you need a trade name or a business name, there can be a lot of legal costs.

    There may need to be sign painting for your premises, for your vehicle.

    02:55 Interviewer: Ok, so we've worked out how much money we're going to need, how do you now go about preparing a business plan?

    Taylor-Rose: Well there's a very good saying that I often use, "that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail".  It's absolutely vital in my mind that you have to write something down.  Do it in clear, straightforward language. Have a general background details to the business: what you're trying to achieve. Make clear when you've found the business, highlight any achievements you've already had, which are important because that demonstrates experience and knowledge.

    A secondary part, but equally important part, of the business plan, is the financial aspect. These will include your monthly profit and loss forecast and your cashflow forecast. Both of these are vital. Cash is the key one: you need to get control of your cash. Cash is key. Without having the cash in your business it will not succeed.

    05:30 Interviewer: Then how do you work out how much you actually need?

    Taylor-Rose: Well this basically is going back to the business plan and the financial aspects of the business plan. If you're in a position to borrow, consider getting more than you need.

    And that might sound a funny comment, coming from a banker, but it's always important that you've got enough finance. There's nothing worse than going down your business plan and three months in thinking 'Gosh, I'm running short of cash, where am I going?' You need all your energies to focus on running that business.

    So really make sure you've covered all those hidden costs and running costs that we spoke about in an earlier question. And make sure that you've borrowed enough to cover you for a margin and a buffer for unforeseen circumstances.

    Interviewer: Ok Anthony, but what specific areas of business would this finance be needed for?

    Taylor-Rose: Well at the very least, of course, you need the business plan that we've spoken about before. That is essential because that describes your vision. That describes what you want to achieve.  That will list what you have achieved in terms of experience. So at the very least you do need your business plan with you.

    Be confident. You've probably thought about this idea for a long, long time, so be confident, but not over confident. Make sure that you present a warm picture of what you're looking to achieve. Be positive in it, but not over positive.

    Shoemaker: There were other people involved.
    Seelig: There were other people involved? It wasn't just you? Okay, we'll give you all the credit. It's pretty impressive, anyway. And then, we've got Josh Schwarzapel, who also was a Mayfield Fellow, so I got to know him quite well over the last few years. And he is also on the founding team. And graduated from Stanford a year and a half ago. And was on the Stanford men's volleyball team.

    So we'll hear all about this. And let's get started. 

    I have one confession to make. I am a huge fan of Cooliris. I am such a fan of Cooliris that whenever I go to a web site that is not Cooliris enabled, I get very upset. And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me cool evangelist cards ..

    Seelig: And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me cool evangelist cards that I give out to everybody. So, uh, that's a little, uh, full disclosure at the beginning.

    So, um, you guys, this is kind of an interesting founding team. How did you guys all get to know each other? So, Sujanya, maybe you could tell us how this all ...

    Bhumkar: Sure, yeh. Actually, the company was started back in Jan of 06. And this came up with an idea. I had a friend of mine who called. It was a very simple idea, saying if you mouse over a link, then you can see a page, like a .. And Josh and I had actually met at the previous start-up. Josh used to come on several of the studies and had given us some advice and feedback. And he and I stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry, and wanted to conquer the world.

    Bhumkar: had given us some advice and feedback. And he and I stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry, and wanted to conquer the world. And very well-connected. So Josh and I, we were chatting about this, what we could do, potentially, And Josh says, I know a genius who has attended a class with me. And that genius is Austin. I says, why don't we all figure out and .. So we started out with a very simple thing. And I fairly believe, it's much easier to just to sort of jump in. As long as there's a basic boundary. That's where we have, what we knew. And we got started and very soon Josh was instrumental in getting us Gion, who helped us on some things, and XXXX, another champion student who was doing his PhD back then. And that's how the team was formed.
    Seelig: Right. Well.

    Seelig: It is my extreme pleasure to introduce our guest today. We have Jensen Huang, who is a co-founder of NVIDIA. And I want to tell you, eighteen years ago he was sitting in your seat. He was an MS student, master's student here at Electrical Engineering and two years after he graduated he founded the company. And he has been the president, CEO and member of the board of directors since its inception.

    One of the most wonderful things about having him here today is our kick-off Spring Quarter is he is also the incredibly generous donor to the School of Engineering. The new building that you see going up just outside is going to be named the Huang Building. And he gave thirty million dollars to name that building. So, hopefully, eighteen years from now, you guys'll be doing the same.

    So, ah. Without further ado, Jensen Huang. Thank you.

    Thank you, Tina. I gave my last, last pennies to Jim Plummer to build that building. Now, I am officially broke. So, um, instead of giving you a company presentation today, what I thought I would do is just have a conversation with you. You know, at any time, if you have a question, if you would like to change the direction of our conversation, just raise your hand and we'll talk about whatever comes up.

    Um, a lot of people talk about and write about building companies. And I can tell you first hand, that building a company is extraordinarily gratifying. It is also incredibly hard. And so the things that, that, um, uh, that you want to talk about, uh, with respect to the company-building process, is rather expansive. You could talk about company building processes from a lot of different perspectives. So I'm going to try and touch on a few of them that I think are particularly important in my experience.

    So sixteen years ago, NVIDIA had three people, three engineers. I was one of them. And, um, we had a perspective. Am I still on? Did I do something? Was that me? We had a perspective that, um, that, uh, hey, hey,

    You know I was just talking to those two. I went in the back to talk to the two guys and I asked them, So this is where command center is. They go, Yep. And I so, Do you guys get paid for this? And they said, Nope. Now I understand why.
    
    You think it's me? How about if I just did that? See, it's .. You can't beat.. You can't control user stupidity, you know? You're good. You're good. It was probably me. I was sitting on it.
    
    All right. So, so, um, sixteen years ago, uh, we started NVIDIA. And, um, uh, the insight that we had. Some people call it vision. Um, vision is an awfully big word to me.

    Vision's an awfully big word to me, because I believe, first of all, vision matters. Let me tell you that. Vision matters.  And I hope you understand that in a second. Um, but I like to use the word, perspective, because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. When you say vision, it feels like only a few selected visionaries of the world can have one. but everyone has a perspective. And that's in fact all vision means. That you see the world in a way that is either, uh, different, um, or otherwise, okay, than, than somebody else. Uh, and you see opportunities that I think are. that you believe are particularly important to go and address. That you can address in a particular way. 

    And so perspective, um, our perspective at the time, this is 1993. You guys won't remember this, but, uh, the PC, um was Windows 3.1.

    5:45 And the PC was becoming used for desktop or office animation. 

    Our perspective was that this particular device was unique in the sense that it has the ability to run programs. And what if we give it the benefit of running 3-D graphics programs, so that you could explore new worlds, games, you know, play games.

    And so, we started a company and the business plan, basically, read something like this: We're going to take technology that was available only in the most expensive workstations. We're going to try to make it, reinvent the technology and make it inexpensive.

    6:33 And the killer app was video games.

    And so I took this idea to Sand Hill Road, and they told me there was no video game market. People don't start companies to play games. And my parents, my mom, I remember calling my mom and telling her I'm going to start this company and she says, you know, What do you guys do, and I said, We build these things called 3-D graphics, chips, and people will use them to play games. And she said, Why don't you go get a job? And so, I umm...

    7:08 Now, of course, of course games was, we believe, going to be a very large part of the marketplace. Now we had that perspective for very obvious reasons. We grew up in the video game generation. I was the video game generation. I was the beginning of the video game generation. And so the entertainment value of video games, computer games was very obvious to me. And I could imagine how it could be a very large market, and a very large industry. For a lot of the people that were older, that sensibility didn't exist. And so, notice ...

    7:43 I've just described to you a perspective about the world that we had that is apparently, obviously, now true, because video games is the world's largest digital media industry today. It is apparently true. And yet at the time, our common sense was unique. Nobody would have created the technology, nobody would have created the company with the sole purpose of building technology to make video games possible. And so that was our perspective. Now we felt that that video games would, would of course fuel the technology development but you could use this technology for a whole bunch of other reasons.

    CD-ROM was about to be introduced. There were no PCs with networks. Um, wireless technology was . If you said, if somebody said, Radio. I think you would .. the word that would come to mind is FM radio. Uh, and so wireless technology didn't exist.
    The fastest microprocessor in the world was a 66 mHz
    
    And, one of my favorite applications ... this happened about, I guess about five years ago ... a small company, a struggling company here in Silicon Valley, called Keyhole. And they were , they created a 3-D virtual world. And it had no application. This 3-D virtual world, when you start out in space, you see the Earth, you zoom into any location you want, just by typing in the address, I thought it was such a fabulous way of exploring the world, going to places you've never been. And they couldn't raise a penny. And so, we er, we er, I was so excited about the company we put money into the company. And I went everywhere and showed that demonstration. I would tell people that this is the way we're going to do search someday. You want to search for something, and look for an address, You would type it in and we'd fly you there. Okay? And satellite images will continue to download and before you know it, you're right there on the street. And You might even see some buildings. That small company was eventually purchased by Google, and became Google Earth. Google Earth is now the single largest most downloaded frequently downloaded application in the history of mankind. Over 200 plus million downloads. So 3-D graphics could be used for a lot more than video games.
