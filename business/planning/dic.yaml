    Interviewer: What are the most important things to do when planning in business?
    Graham: It's important to have a clear idea about your business goal. Don't worry about the jargon--it's often called mission statements or vision statements--but just remember that you cannot plan a journey without a destination in mind. So you need to know where it is you want to go.

    Choose the structure of your business very carefully,

    ... and don't reinvent the wheel. There is a lot of, er, good guides out there in the marketplace. This structure will then lead you logically and sequentially through all the activities that you need to do.

    Planning is very, very important. For start-up businesses, new businesses, you can make your mistakes on paper. And for established businesses embarking on new projects, the same applies.
    
    One particular tip: desktop market research

    ... is great and is very valuable. But research carried out talking to real clients who really want to buy your service or your product breathe ... breathes life into any plan. Also, if you talk to clients and potential clients and find they don't like your offer, you can then find out what it is you would need to do in order for them to buy some adapted or revised offer.

    So use your clients to market test your ideas and help you refine your plan. And again, this applies to both start-up, new businesses and established businesses. And with established businesses, it is always worth undertaking independent research. Sometimes clients prefer to talk to third parties, especially if they have concerns. And remember that this is the analysis of these concerns that helps shape the business moving forward, and make it a better business.

  - The Green and Black story
  - business

  - |+
    00:15 It's great to be here today to, to, um, tell you a little bit more about about Green and Black's. And I'll start with the only chart of the presentation, and I promise that it's the only chart, that has any numbers in it. And, and this actually shows the sales of Green and Black's by year. And as you'll see, the company actually started quite a long time ago, back in 1991. And you can see how we've grown, you know, ever since. Um, our total international sales now are in excess of sixty million. So that's the sort of scale of business that we're dealing with.

    I want to concentrate today on, um, on the three key moments, I think, in the business's life, and indeed, in the brand's life. So, I'll tell you a little bit about how, how, Green and Black's started, because I think it's important on any business or on any brand, to understand what the original idea was and the roots of the brand.

    So that's the first star on the chart, there. The second is, perhaps, a phase for the business that was, uh, um, not so good. This was a business that had a great idea, but that started to struggle in terms of its financial ability. The company actually got into some difficulty and was refinanced by new backing coming in. The backing of 1999. And as part of that, a new team joined, of which I was a part.

    To try and look at how we took this very special idea and turned it into a fast-growth business, but it certainly hasn't been plain sailing all the way through. And I actually think there is as much value, um, telling you about some of the things that went wrong and how we dealt with them, as much as it being just the good news that's followed thereafter. And then the final star on the chart just denotes the  . We were acquired as a business by Cadbury in 2005. So how does a ...
    02:12 The name Green and Black's. Um, marketers, and there are many of you among the audience today. We're all very good at doing brand pyramids and brand essence charts and lots of fancy ways of trying to describe our brands. But, I always say to people, the positioning, or the strategy behind Green and Black's is in the name, and always has been.

    So from Day One, Green for organic. And we've, right from the start, every product that's sold under the Green and Black's label has always been organic. It's not been one of those brands that's tagged it on lately. And the Black's of Green and Black's denotes the style of the brand, the cachet that comes with it, but most importantly, the fact that the very first bar we introduced was seventy percent cocoa. So a dark chocolate that compared to Cadbury Chocolate or Nestle chocolate, or the regular chocolate that people in the U.K. were used to eating, I mean, it looks almost physically black in color. So that's where the name came from.

    And people often say, Well, who came up with the name. And, um, Was there actually a Mr Green or a Mrs Black, or something like that. And the answer is, they were not called Mr Green and Mrs Black's. But there were two founders. And they were a husband and wife team. And, um, there they are. Craig Sams. Craig's an American. He came to the U.K. during the late 50's and never returned back home. So he came and had a schooling in the U.K. And Craig is probably the sort of foremost organic and eco-food entrepreneur in the U.K. So, whilst Anita Roddick was doing Body Shop, Craig was selling brown rice in Notting Hill. Opened a macrobiotic restaurant in 1965. Claims to have had the Beatles amongst some of his earliest customers. And then started a wholesale business supplying vegetarian restaurants in and around London and the South East.

    So this was someone whose whole sort of system and his motivations were all about organic and ethical food. The problem was, of course, if you think back then, um, not many other people were particularly interested in those things. So Craig's like one of those brilliant entrepreneurs who's always ahead of the curve. And, um, again as most entrepreneurs find, while they have real creative genius, um, the problem is they get bored with running the business, and they're off on to their next idea. So Craig had this amazing idea, but arguably he didn't turn it into a good commercial business.

    Um, but more on that later.  

    The other big part of Green and Black's, and I always say Craig is the Green of Green and Black's, and um, his wife, a lady called Josephine Fairley. Some of the ladies in the audience might know the name Jo Fairley. Her day job, back then and still today, is um, a journalist. She writes about beauty products and for many years, she was the resident beauty columnist in You Magazine, on The Mail on Sunday.

    So Jo is very much the luxury side of Green and Black's. She's a total chocoholic. She has got an interest in environmental issues. But her biggest deal in life is having great chocolate, and lots of indulgences. So, it's the fusion of Green and Black's, right from the early days.

    05:08 This is the very first bar of Green and Black's. And I guess, you know, some of you in the room will be running your own businesses and you'll realize that the idea of hiring a design agency is a nice idea, but you simply can't afford it. So this was actually done at home by Craig on his Apple Mac. He's again ahead of the game, having an Apple Mac, way back then. But, the founders actually designed the pack, knocked it up, and got the first few packs printed.

    But I always go back to this pack, because I think it's a brilliant explanation of what Green and Black's is about. I mean, really a high-quality chocolate with third-party verification. So we use the Soil Association in the U.K. to say we're organic, rather than making a vague claim about natural [...] And better than anything else, I think, I mean, having the balls to actually put the ingredients list on the front of the pack, rather than the back. Because they were so confident that this was a chocolate with no nasties. So why not actually announce what we have. It's all about high levels of cocoa. And not much more.

    And that pack was what set Green and Black's on its path. And Dark 70 Percent was the very first bar we launched. And is still the biggest selling line in the range today. And we have about 65 lines now, I think, in the Green and Black's portfolio. But this is still the Number One. So the original idea still cuts it.

    Simon: William Kendall is our next speaker. He has the kind of background that makes us all feel like serial-underachievers. Well, certainly me, anyway. His educational achievements include a law degree from Cambridge and an MBA from INSEAD. His early career included a stint in the army, time as a barrister and an investment banker, before he discovered the joys of entrepreneurship running the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He then took an embryonic brand, Green and Black's and led the organization through massive growth to a highly successful sale to Cadbury's. He now splits his time between advising governments and businesses on a variety of topics. He's an active and passionate environmentalist. And a firm believer in the positive impact that organizations can have on both society and the environment.

    I am delighted to welcome the exceptionally erudite William Kendall.

    Kendall: Thank you very much. Gosh, flattery indeed. You'll be pleased to know, or maybe not pleased to know, that I have no paraphernalia. I've got no motorized skateboards. I've got no fire. There's no, there's fifteen minutes of me talking. Which, you know, I'm sorry, no slides even. I was asked whether I wanted a white slide or a black slide, and I even delegated responsibility for that to the gentleman at the back. They've come up with a white slide. So, you know, I think it's good. Cool.

    Um. I want to talk to you, I want to really ask you, what is innovation and creativity. Because we talk about it a lot. We've been talking about it a lot today. And I think there's quite a lot of uncertainty about it. And then I want to say, why is there so little of it in most organizations. And then challenge you to do something about it, as you have been challenged already, by my previous speakers. So what is innovation? I'm often called an entrepreneur, and, you know, I don't think it is about brilliant ideas. I'm going to differ with Simon here. I think it's about taking everyday ideas and just making them happen.

    I heard Maurice Saatchi on the radio a couple of weeks ago, celebrating, I don't know what it is, the fiftieth anniversary, or some great anniversary of the wonderful organization. And he was asked about the legacy of Saatchi. He said it was actually a few people who dared to believe that they could change the world. And I think that's a lovely idea. But, you know, that seems rather elitist to me. That only a few people dare to think this. You know, in so many organizations, I come across innovation teams, and you wonder why innovation is not driven throughout the organization. Why do you need innovation teams? And so often in those organizations, even the innovation teams don't seem to be innovating to me.

    But this is so odd, because the majority of people bring about significant change in their everyday lives. You know, we go home and we change our utility suppliers. We repaint the bathroom. We deal with family crises. We, you know, organize huge social events, like, sort of, carnivals, or whatever. We make massive capex decisions involving several times our annual revenue, like buying a new house.

    And we do all this, you know, very, very rationally, and we do it without endless layers of bureaucracy. Which so many organizations seem to require before any decision is made, and more often than not, is not made. So why is this? Why don't these same people who are making these monumental decisions (And that's you, by the way) make these things happen in their workplace? And you know, my, I, I, I don't have all the answers to this, but I guess it has to be because the leadership teams don't provide the right framework to enable this to happen. Because, you know, the people are doing it in another framework quite happily.

    And I fear it's because as organizations grow, the desire to control and avoid the risk of failure takes over from the need to be creative to survive. Which is what the organizations I tend to deal with, the entrepreneurial organizations, need. Um, yeah, creativity everyday is our lifeblood.
    
    So if you do nothing about it, as a consequence, the organization ultimately is overcome by a massive failure. It becomes bureaucratic, sclerotic, and death follows. That's if you do nothing. So what I say to you today is you have a responsibility to challenge the inevitability of this process. And, you know, I question, do you believe that we can change things in life, or are you one of those people who thinks that your actions are irrelevant. Are you one of those people who switches off the lights. Or do you not bother anymore, because you know nobody else is going to.

    I do switch off the lights. And I often wonder why am I this person. You know, maybe it's a hollow gesture. But I have always believed that I can make a difference as an individual. I think it's because I grew up on a farm. And, I don't know if any of you know anything about farmers. There aren't many around these days, But you know, nothing happens on farms unless you do it yourself. When the cattle get out in the middle of the night, nobody comes to put them in unless you do it yourself. So you grow up as a child, believing that you have to fix things.

    05:20 And you know, as you've heard from Simon, I then left being a farmer, which was probably quite a sensible thing to do and I became a barrister, and then a banker. But I was very, very frustrated by the fact that I was very, very junior in large organizations. And, you know, I wasn't expected to fix things. I saw things going wrong. But, you know, there was no process for me to get involved.

    One of my last efforts in my banking career was when I had planned a trip to Scandinavia to do what I thought was a very innovative fact-finding tour for clients who'd already asked me to do it. And I was told by my boss that I couldn't do it. And so I hit him. And, which ... I'm not recommending this, by the way, as a strategy. But I hit him out of sheer frustration. By the way, I've not hit somebody since. And I haven't hit anybody before. Probably I did hit somebody once when I was five. But I haven't hit anybody much.

    And I hit this guy. And I'm appalled by it. And amazingly, I didn't lose my job. I also made the mistake of (I was an investment banker) I hit him in the middle of a trading floor. So it was not a discreet activity. And, of course, there was a huge cheer from the traders, who felt ..  But I did it out of sheer frustration because I knew that I was doing something that was right for the business. But because it hadn't been endorsed by all these layers of bureaucracy, I was prevented from doing it.

    So as a consequence of this I realized I was unemployable. I needed somewhere where I could go and just get on with it. And so I was lucky enough to get involved with the New Covent Garden Soup Company after leaving business school. New Covent Garden Soup Company was a business based on not accepting 'No' for an answer. We came up with a new patented technology, which is very unusual in the food industry, which was devised when the boffins said to us, 'You could either make fresh home-made soup, or you could give soup a decent shelf life, but you couldn't do both.' Well, we did do both.

    It was based on a constant stream of new products. And when the supermarkets said that we had to give them three months' notice of new products, we devised something called 'Soup of the Month', which is now not very radical, but at the time, which was a single product, but we just changed what went into it. But it was, you know, it had the same barcode on it. And that somehow got round the system. And we were able to deliver what our customers wanted, which was, you know, a fresh soup every day, or every week, or every month.

    And it was based on a culture where everybody felt involved. Yes, everybody played in their particular position in the organization, but everyone felt responsible for coming up with new ideas and selling products. Everybody, even the accounts team, had to go out on the stands and sell soup to customers. Because otherwise they didn't know what the business was involved. 
    
    Everybody was encouraged to have new ideas. One of the best soups we ever sold was devised, wasn't devised, it was produced by our board ledger clerk, Nina, who had been bringing it in every day, and one day, she was asked to come up with a recipe and it turned out to be her grandmother's recipe.  

    We produced the best-selling soup. Four million copies were sold. And many of the soups in it were from employees. But not from a new product development team. They came from all over the company. And everybody believed. It was a very democratic .. It's a very democratic food, soup. Ninety-nine percent of the world eats soup. And it was very democratic within our business.

    So when we found Green and Black's we built on all of the above. And, but added to it. So it was a business that, then, it was based on the belief that you could persuade the British to enjoy dark chocolate, something that up until then we had certainly eschewed, with the possible exception of Bourneville. So a radical idea. And it was also based on a belief, a marketing belief, that you could turn a simple bar of chocolate into an item of luxury, that could even be taken to a dinner party as a gift.

    It was based on a belief that new products and ideas should be turned into finished products in just a few weeks. I often see people who are developing new products in consumer goods companies. And they show you a Christmas product and you say, That's fantastic. I'm really looking forward to it.' And they say, 'Don't hold your breath. This is for Christmas, 2012,' or whatever. It takes that long to get through the layers of bureaucracy. And you know that, by then, it's not a fresh idea.

    And Green and Black's was based on the belief that a few people in the U.K. selling chocolate can really change the lives of others by their actions. We launched the first-ever Fairtrade product in the U.K. And we helped build a sustainably profitable cocoa industry in the impoverished south of Belize in Toledo, which, really, really has made a difference.

    It's a trip that sort of changed my life, going out and actually having spoken about it for years, actually realizing that you really can make a difference to your supply chain. Especially, you know, if you get involved yourself, and you just don't buy into some clever brand like Fairtrade. But you actually know the people who you're working with.


    And this brought us enormous benefits. I mean, not only, one of the first benefits was it became a really cool place to work. Green and Black's was the place to work. So, recruitment became that much easier. But everybody wanted to talk to us. Everybody wanted to talk about us. So, a business that had no marketing resource at all suddenly we had a PR campaign where we, you know, it was Blair's Britain. And we were somehow the Third Wave, the acceptable face of capitalism. And on every media opportunity, I was interviewed, or somebody else in the organization was interviewed, about, you know, whether capitalism had to be so gruesome. I mean, a lot of it was a load of rubbish, but it gave us fantastic media time. And, um, the brand was built up. It became a third-dimensional, a three-dimensional brand. Because it wasn't just about making chocolate. It was about changing people's lives. And the reason it was about changing people's lives, we really believed in, everybody in the organization believed in it. And everybody engaged in this debate. It wasn't just me, the CEO talking about it, it was everybody, at every level of the organization, talking about how you can make a difference.

    We sold the business five years ago. And everybody predicted the quality collapse when Cadbury's bought the business. But in fact they have been utterly devoted to the brand's quality and its ethics. What has been much more difficult is maintaining the entrpreneurial quality of the business, the entrepreneurial attitude that I've described. And, it's been, it's been a real challenge. And I think why it's been very difficult is that, um, it's that, you know, we have lost the ownership in the business. Everybody at Green and Black's believed that they were owners in the business. Most of them were in fact owners with shares in it. But by taking away that ownership, that responsibility, it produced a massive shock, and I think it could easily have been replaced, but it was not, that wasn't prepared for. And, so Green and Black's is still thriving. Its products are fantastic, still. It's still changing people's lives. But, um, as I observe it now, it's perhaps become rather middle-aged and corpulent, and not as fleet as foot as it was five years ago. And so, you know, there is a challenge.

    So, I, my final point is I said I was going to challenge you. What are you doing in your own organizations to, about this? Are you trying to, you know, fix the problems? Have you identified problems, but are you turning your backs on them? I recently met the head of innovation of a large consumer goods organization. And I was interviewing her for a job. And it wasn't, it was quite boring, actually. And I, um, I was rather intrigued. I said: So, tell me in your current job, if you have a really, really good idea, how do you get it to work within that organization. How do you take that idea through the organization? And she said: If I have a really, really good idea, I'd take it and run, and do it outside the organization. I'd leave. I thought that this was a tragic admission of defeat. But I wonder how many of you feel that about your organization. Do you feel that there are things that you can do, are there, do you have great ideas, and do you think that you could develop them within the organization? Or if you had a really, really good idea, you're like that person? Would you run and do it outside? If you're like that, then I say that, you know, there's something wrong with you, because it's your responsibility to fix it within that organization, your organization.

    So, thank you very much. And I look forward to questions.

But it was, you know, it had the same barcode on it. And that somehow got round the system. And we were able to deliver what our customers wanted, which was, you know, a fresh soup every day, or every week, or every month.

    And it was based on a culture where everybody felt involved. Yes, everybody played in their particular position in the organization, but everyone felt responsible for coming up with new ideas and selling products. Everybody, even the accounts team, had to go out on the stands and sell soup to customers. Because otherwise they didn't know what the business was involved. 
    
    Everybody was encouraged to have new ideas. One of the best soups we ever sold was devised, wasn't devised, it was produced by our board ledger clerk, Nina, who had been bringing it in every day, and one day, she was asked to come up with a recipe and it turned out to be her grandmother's recipe.  

    We produced the best-selling soup. Four million copies were sold. And many of the soups in it were from employees. But not from a new product development team. They came from all over the company. And everybody believed. It was a very democratic .. It's a very democratic food, soup. Ninety-nine percent of the world eats soup. And it was very democratic within our business.

    So when we found Green and Black's we built on all of the above. And, but added to it. So it was a business that, then, it was based on the belief that you could persuade the British to enjoy dark chocolate, something that up until then we had certainly eschewed, with the possible exception of Bourneville. So a radical idea. And it was also based on a belief, a marketing belief, that you could turn a simple bar of chocolate into an item of luxury, that could even be taken to a dinner party as a gift.

    It was based on a belief that new products and ideas should be turned into finished products in just a few weeks. I often see people who are developing new products in consumer goods companies. And they show you a Christmas product and you say, That's fantastic. I'm really looking forward to it.' And they say, 'Don't hold your breath. This is for Christmas, 2012,' or whatever. It takes that long to get through the layers of bureaucracy. And you know that, by then, it's not a fresh idea.

    And Green and Black's was based on the belief that a few people in the U.K. selling chocolate can really change the lives of others by their actions. We launched the first-ever Fairtrade product in the U.K. And we helped build a sustainably profitable cocoa industry in the impoverished south of Belize in Toledo, which, really, really has made a difference.

    It's a trip that sort of changed my life, going out and actually having spoken about it for years, actually realizing that you really can make a difference to your supply chain. Especially, you know, if you get involved yourself, and you just don't buy into some clever brand like Fairtrade. But you actually know the people who you're working with.


    And this brought us enormous benefits. I mean, not only, one of the first benefits was it became a really cool place to work. Green and Black's was the place to work. So, recruitment became that much easier. But everybody wanted to talk to us. Everybody wanted to talk about us. So, a business that had no marketing resource at all suddenly we had a PR campaign where we, you know, it was Blair's Britain. And we were somehow the Third Wave, the acceptable face of capitalism. And on every media opportunity, I was interviewed, or somebody else in the organization was interviewed, about, you know, whether capitalism had to be so gruesome. I mean, a lot of it was a load of rubbish, but it gave us fantastic media time. And, um, the brand was built up. It became a third-dimensional, a three-dimensional brand. Because it wasn't just about making chocolate. It was about changing people's lives. And the reason it was about changing people's lives, we really believed in, everybody in the organization believed in it. And everybody engaged in this debate. It wasn't just me, the CEO talking about it, it was everybody, at every level of the organization, talking about how you can make a difference.

    We sold the business five years ago. And everybody predicted the quality collapse when Cadbury's bought the business. But in fact they have been utterly devoted to the brand's quality and its ethics. What has been much more difficult is maintaining the entrpreneurial quality of the business, the entrepreneurial attitude that I've described. And, it's been, it's been a real challenge. And I think why it's been very difficult is that, um, it's that, you know, we have lost the ownership in the business. Everybody at Green and Black's believed that they were owners in the business. Most of them were in fact owners with shares in it. But by taking away that ownership, that responsibility, it produced a massive shock, and I think it could easily have been replaced, but it was not, that wasn't prepared for. And, so Green and Black's is still thriving. Its products are fantastic, still. It's still changing people's lives. But, um, as I observe it now, it's perhaps become rather middle-aged and corpulent, and not as fleet as foot as it was five years ago. And so, you know, there is a challenge.

    So, I, my final point is I said I was going to challenge you. What are you doing in your own organizations to, about this? Are you trying to, you know, fix the problems? Have you identified problems, but are you turning your backs on them? I recently met the head of innovation of a large consumer goods organization. And I was interviewing her for a job. And it wasn't, it was quite boring, actually. And I, um, I was rather intrigued. I said: So, tell me in your current job, if you have a really, really good idea, how do you get it to work within that organization. How do you take that idea through the organization? And she said: If I have a really, really good idea, I'd take it and run, and do it outside the organization. I'd leave. I thought that this was a tragic admission of defeat. But I wonder how many of you feel that about your organization. Do you feel that there are things that you can do, are there, do you have great ideas, and do you think that you could develop them within the organization? Or if you had a really, really good idea, you're like that person? Would you run and do it outside? If you're like that, then I say that, you know, there's something wrong with you, because it's your responsibility to fix it within that organization, your organization.

    So, thank you very much. And I look forward to questions.

    Simon: William Kendall is our next speaker. He has the kind of background that makes us all feel like serial-underachievers. Well, certainly me, anyway. His educational achievements include a law degree from Cambridge and an MBA from INSEAD. His early career included a stint in the army, time as a barrister and an investment banker, before he discovered the joys of entrepreneurship running the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He then took an embryonic brand, Green and Black's and led the organization through massive growth to a highly successful sale to Cadbury's. He now splits his time between advising governments and businesses on a variety of topics. He's an active and passionate environmentalist. And a firm believer in the positive impact that organizations can have on both society and the environment.

    I am delighted to welcome the exceptionally erudite William Kendall.

    Kendall: Thank you very much. Gosh, flattery indeed. You'll be pleased to know, or maybe not pleased to know, that I have no paraphernalia. I've got no motorized skateboards. I've got no fire. There's no, there's fifteen minutes of me talking. Which, you know, I'm sorry, no slides even. I was asked whether I wanted a white slide or a black slide, and I even delegated responsibility for that to the gentleman at the back. They've come up with a white slide. So, you know, I think it's good. Cool.

    Um. I want to talk to you, I want to really ask you, what is innovation and creativity. Because we talk about it a lot. We've been talking about it a lot today. And I think there's quite a lot of uncertainty about it. And then I want to say, why is there so little of it in most organizations. And then challenge you to do something about it, as you have been challenged already, by my previous speakers. So what is innovation? I'm often called an entrepreneur, and, you know, I don't think it is about brilliant ideas. I'm going to differ with Simon here. I think it's about taking everyday ideas and just making them happen.

    I heard Maurice Saatchi on the radio a couple of weeks ago, celebrating, I don't know what it is, the fiftieth anniversary, or some great anniversary of the wonderful organization. And he was asked about the legacy of Saatchi. He said it was actually a few people who dared to believe that they could change the world. And I think that's a lovely idea. But, you know, that seems rather elitist to me. That only a few people dare to think this. You know, in so many organizations, I come across innovation teams, and you wonder why innovation is not driven throughout the organization. Why do you need innovation teams? And so often in those organizations, even the innovation teams don't seem to be innovating to me.

    But this is so odd, because the majority of people bring about significant change in their everyday lives. You know, we go home and we change our utility suppliers. We repaint the bathroom. We deal with family crises. We, you know, organize huge social events, like, sort of, carnivals, or whatever. We make massive capex decisions involving several times our annual revenue, like buying a new house.

    And we do all this, you know, very, very rationally, and we do it without endless layers of bureaucracy. Which so many organizations seem to require before any decision is made, and more often than not, is not made. So why is this? Why don't these same people who are making these monumental decisions (And that's you, by the way) make these things happen in their workplace? And you know, my, I, I, I don't have all the answers to this, but I guess it has to be because the leadership teams don't provide the right framework to enable this to happen. Because, you know, the people are doing it in another framework quite happily.

    And I fear it's because as organizations grow, the desire to control and avoid the risk of failure takes over from the need to be creative to survive. Which is what the organizations I tend to deal with, the entrepreneurial organizations, need. Um, yeah, creativity everyday is our lifeblood.
    
    So if you do nothing about it, as a consequence, the organization ultimately is overcome by a massive failure. It becomes bureaucratic, sclerotic, and death follows. That's if you do nothing. So what I say to you today is you have a responsibility to challenge the inevitability of this process. And, you know, I question, do you believe that we can change things in life, or are you one of those people who thinks that your actions are irrelevant. Are you one of those people who switches off the lights. Or do you not bother anymore, because you know nobody else is going to.

    I do switch off the lights. And I often wonder why am I this person. You know, maybe it's a hollow gesture. But I have always believed that I can make a difference as an individual. I think it's because I grew up on a farm. And, I don't know if any of you know anything about farmers. There aren't many around these days, But you know, nothing happens on farms unless you do it yourself. When the cattle get out in the middle of the night, nobody comes to put them in unless you do it yourself. So you grow up as a child, believing that you have to fix things.

    And you know, as you heard from Simon, I then left being a farmer, which was probably quite a sensible thing to do and I became a barrister, and then a banker. But I was very, very frustrated ...

    05:20 And you know, as you've heard from Simon, I then left being a farmer, which was probably quite a sensible thing to do and I became a barrister, and then a banker. But I was very, very frustrated by the fact that I was very, very junior in large organizations. And, you know, I wasn't expected to fix things. I saw things going wrong. But, you know, there was no process for me to get involved.

    One of my last efforts in my banking career was when I had planned a trip to Scandinavia to do what I thought was a very innovative fact-finding tour for clients who'd already asked me to do it. And I was told by my boss that I couldn't do it. And so I hit him. And, which ... I'm not recommending this, by the way, as a strategy. But I hit him out of sheer frustration. By the way, I've not hit somebody since. And I haven't hit anybody before. Probably I did hit somebody once when I was five. But I haven't hit anybody much.

    And I hit this guy. And I'm appalled by it. And amazingly, I didn't lose my job. I also made the mistake of (I was an investment banker) I hit him in the middle of a trading floor. So it was not a discreet activity. And, of course, there was a huge cheer from the traders, who felt ..  But I did it out of sheer frustration because I knew that I was doing something that was right for the business. But because it hadn't been endorsed by all these layers of bureaucracy, I was prevented from doing it.

    So as a consequence of this I realized I was unemployable. I needed somewhere where I could go and just get on with it. And so I was lucky enough to get involved with the New Covent Garden Soup Company after leaving business school. New Covent Garden Soup Company was a business based on not accepting 'No' for an answer. We came up with a new patented technology, which is very unusual in the food industry, which was devised when the boffins said to us, 'You could either make fresh home-made soup, or you could give soup a decent shelf life, but you couldn't do both.' Well, we did do both.

    It was based on a constant stream of new products. And when the supermarkets said that we had to give them three months' notice of new products, we devised something called 'Soup of the Month', which is now not very radical, but at the time, which was a single product, but we just changed what went into it. But it was, you know, it had the same barcode on it. And that somehow got round the system.

    Sams: 00:00 We've really seen benefits after 15 years of working to Fairtrade and organic standards in Belize. And I'm confident that those benefits of education, health, prosperity, biodiversity, and environmental gains will start to materialize on an ever-increasing scale in the Dominican Republic as a result of this Fairtrade initiative.

    A premium product has to give real satisfaction for the customer. An ethical product has benefits that go beyond the immediate satisfaction, satisfaction of the person who's eating it, because that premium that they've paid for the chocolate goes through to the farmers and has benefits that last and last.

    The farmers appreciate that. They love the security. They value the higher price they are being paid. And so when it comes to harvesting their cacao, fermenting it, drying it--all of the areas where the flavor of the beans is really developed--they give it 100 percent. Because they want and appreciate .. they want our business, they appreciate the support they're getting from the people who eat the chocolate.

    That means that we get cocoa beans of such an exceptional quality that that comes through in the flavor of the finished chocolate. And that's what makes it a premium product.

    Kendall: 10:35 And this brought us enormous benefits. I mean, not only one of the first benefits, it became a really cool place to work. Green and Black's was the place to work. So recruitment became that much easier. But everybody wanted to talk to us. Everybody wanted to talk about us. So a business that had no marketing resource at all, suddenly we had a PR campaign, where we, you know, it was Blair's Britain, and we were somehow the Third Wave, as the acceptable face of capitalism.

It became a third-dimensional, a three-dimensional brand, because it wasn't just about making chocolate, it was about changing people's lives. And the reason it was about changing people's lives, we really believed in, everybody in the organization, believed in it. And everybody, engaged in this debate. It wasn't just me the CEO talking about it. It was everybody at every level of the organization talking about how you could make a difference.

    Fairley: 00:22 But in fact this and just about everything else I have ever done has actually been shaped by my experience. Not as a business person, because I left school at 16, with an O-level, 6 O-levels. And the only other qualification I have is a secretarial diploma. But, I have spent a huge amount of time, and over the years, as my bank manager will confirm, money, shopping, staying in hotels, eating in restaurants. And I have always, almost forensically, analyzed what I did and didn't like about the customer service that I encountered. And in fact, there's nothing that has made me more furious in the past than being, than not being respected as a customer.

    Customer service is the lifeblood of any business. You know, you can offer as many promotions as you like. You can slash prices. But unless you can turn that into repeat business, you will not stay in the game for very long. It's about bringing customers back and making them go away happy. Happy enough to pass on positive feedback about your business to others. Who are then also going to talk to other people about what you do. And, you know, turn them on to your company or your product. And so it goes on. This positive spiral.

    Prince Charles: 00:05 The world is gradually waking up to the fact that creating sustainable food systems will become paramount in the future because of the enormous challenges now facing food production. We need to face up to asking whether how we produce our food is actually fit for purpose in the very challenging circumstances of the twenty-first century. if we do not work within Nature’s system, then Nature will fail to be the durable, continuously sustaining force she has always been.

    My concern is simply that we seek to produce the healthiest food possible from the healthiest environment possible for the long term. And to ensure that it is affordable for ordinary consumers. Essentially, we have to do more today to avert the catastrophes of tomorrow. And we can only do that by reframing the way we approach the economic problems that confront us. We have to put Nature back at the heart of the equation.

    Palmer: 05:08 This is the very first bar of Green and Black's. And I guess, you know, some of you in the room will be running your own businesses and you'll realize that the idea of hiring a design agency is a nice idea, but you simply can't afford it. So this was actually done at home by Craig on his Apple Mac. He's again ahead of the game, having an Apple Mac, way back then. But, the founders actually designed the pack, knocked it up, and got the first few packs printed.

    But I always go back to this pack, because I think it's a brilliant explanation of what Green and Black's is about. I mean, really a high-quality chocolate with third-party verification. So we use the Soil Association in the U.K. to say we're organic, rather than making a vague claim about natural [indecipherable] And better than anything else, I think, I mean, having the balls to actually put the ingredients list on the front of the pack, rather than the back. Because they were so confident that this was a chocolate with no nasties. So why not actually announce what we have. It's all about high levels of cocoa. And not much more.

    And that pack was what set Green and Black's on its path. And Dark 70 Percent was the very first bar we launched. And is still the biggest selling line in the range today. And we have about 65 lines now, I think, in the Green and Black's portfolio. But this is still the Number One. So the original idea still cuts it.

    It's important to have clear goals. Running a business is like taking a trip. Just remember that if you don't know where you want to go, and you go ahead without a plan, it's your fault when you are unhappy about what happens to the business. Choose a structure carefully for your business based on that plan. That structure will determine how the business is run.

    Planning is very, very important. Before talking to people who want to use your service or product, you need to do a lot of planning. But it is also very important to talk to clients. You need to see if you have what they are looking for. If you don't have what they want, perhaps your business plans won't be successful.

    Businesses never stop learning new things. The people who run businesses should never stop learning. Business plans may or may not need to change with that new learning. The hard work that goes into creating a business plan will be repaid again and again, if the plan is constantly held in mind. The plan should not be regarded as a boring thing that you create only because other people, for example, your bank or shareholders, want to see it.

    The plan you have written down can be shown to many different people whenever they want to see a business plan. So the hard work writing down the business plan also should not be regarded as a waste of time. It can be reused many times.

    Businesses which grow fast always have good plans and good business planning processes. This has been identified as one of the main reasons for their success. The best business get all the people in the business excited about the plan and make sure everyone feels the company's goals are their personal goals.

    You can't impose a plan on people and expect them to get excited about it and to follow it.  Everyone needs to know what the goal of the company is and to be excited about having a role in reaching that goal. That only happens when everyone feels they themselves are creating the goals of the company and new goals for themselves, at the same time. It doesn't happen when people feel they are just following someone else's goals.

    William Kendall is a successful businessman who became very good at planning ahead. When he owned a business called Covent Garden Soup Company, he found it very difficult to sell it. That was because everyone thought he was a very good businessman. They thought if they bought the company, they wouldn't do as well as him running it. So they thought it would not be a good idea to buy it.

    Therefore, when he started at his next company, Green and Black Chocolates, he immediately started thinking about how to sell it. He went to a very big chocolate company, Cadbury's and asked them if they would like to invest ten percent in the company. They did. And now Cadbury's has bought all of his company. That was his plan.

    Organic food is food grown without the use of farm chemicals. There have always been people who believe in organic food and food which is different than the food other people eat. But the numbers of these people were very small and organic farmers, organic food producers and organic restaurants never made much money.
    Now, however, people like William Kendall and Craig Sams have made a lot of money by selling organic products. Kendall thinks many people with money have becoming dissatisfied with the cheap, packaged food they can buy in supermarkets. They want a closer connection with the production of the food they eat, and they are prepared to pay more for it.

    William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, but he studied law in college and worked as a lawyer and banker, before becoming a businessman. However, at this time, his wife inherited a farm, so he became involved in farming again, although not organic farming. He didn't believe in organic food.
    But he found that the organic products his first company made became very popular. He was very successful with this first company, which marketed fresh soup in a carton, rather than in a can or packet. He changed his views about organic food and he made his own farm an organic farm. 
    Then he took over Craig Sams' organic chocolate company, and he was even more successful.

    Craig Sams is a businessman who is older than William Kendall. His first business was an organic restaurant. He has always had extreme ideas about what food is good for you. His products never had sugar in them. He thinks tomatoes are not good for you. Then he started producing organic chocolate, which is thirty-percent sugar.
    His chocolate became very, very popular. All of the most popular natural food products sold in America are chocolate. But he didn't have the financial resources to build the company fast enough. William Kendall offered to buy a seventy-five-percent share in the company, and the company grew fifty percent each year.
    Now everybody eats some of Sams' chocolate.

    Prince Charles is the son of Queen Elizabeth and will be the next king of England. Everyone thought he was mad twenty to thirty years ago, when he bought a farm and started talking to the vegetables. Then, five years later, he made the farm completely organic. But, now his farm and its products make fifty million pounds a year.
    More and more people started believing in organic food. The organic food market is now worth two billion pounds each year in England. William Kendall was one of the farmers who went to the Prince's farm and learned about organic farming.
    Now William Kendall's own farm is run the same way as the Prince's, without agricultural chemicals.

    William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, so he was learning about the business of food from childhood. He later became a lawyer and a banker and this helped him learn about business practices.

    His wife had also inherited a farm, but she and her family knew nothing about farming. Helping her family running the farm, he learned how to cook. He enjoyed making soup. He thought selling fresh soup would be a good idea. He thought fresh soup would be popular, and he could make a lot of money, because it tastes better than soup in a can.

    A company which also had the idea of selling fresh soup contacted him and he started working there. After some years he became the chief executive of the company, called the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He stayed there for nine years. And sales went from two million pounds to more than twenty million pounds.

    When he saw that the New Covent Garden Soup Company had become successful and there was little for him to do, he decided he wanted to do something else. But it was difficult for him to find someone to buy the business from him. People realized that the company was successful because he was in control. They thought that if someone else took over the company, it wouldn't be as successful as it had been before.

    It took him two years to get a shareholder of the New Covent Garden Soup Company to buy the company. The shareholder was only willing to take over the New Covent Garden Soup Company if William Kendall joined this other company.

    While William Kendall was at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, the company started marketing organic soups, soups made from vegetables grown without any farm chemicals, in addition to soups made from ordinary materials treated with farm chemicals.

    These organic soups were very popular. Kendall realized that lots of people wanted to eat food that was organic and made from natural, unpolluted ingredients. He stopped using farm chemicals on his own farm and with the money he made selling his share of the New Covent Garden Soup Company he bought Green and Black Chocolate from Craig Sams, a very strong supporter of organic foods. Green and Black Chocolate was completely organic. It had no farm chemicals.

    Green and Black Chocolate was very popular with people who only ate organic foods. But Kendall could see that everyone was concerned about healthy food and he believed that Green and Black would become more and more popular in the future.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and that interested him. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    When he took over Green and Black, the company had sales of two million pounds. When the company was sold to a very big chocolate company, six years later, it had sales of twenty-two million pounds.

    William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and he thought that was interesting. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

    People who eat organic food feel they are connected to the food because they are eating food which is pure and does not have chemicals added to it. They feel they know this food and the people who grow it better. It feels more like real food.

    When he took over Green and Black, he had to think about what would happen if Green and Black, which was organic, became very popular. Green and Black was already very popular with people who were strong supporters of organic food like its founder, Craig Sams, but not very popular with people who normally didn't think much about organic food. They didn't know about the chocolate, or felt it was different and strange.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    But William Kendall was expecting that everyone would start buying the chocolate. When it became very popular, he thought he would want to sell his share in it and start another business.

    What he did was get Cadbury's, a very big chocolate company, but which does not produce organic chocolate, to buy five percent of the company's shares. Some people said Green and Black should not have a relationship with a non-organic chocolate company. They thought it was a bad idea, but he thought it was a good idea, because small companies like Green and Black need to cooperate with big companies, like Cadbury's, rather than compete with them. He thought if they compete with them, they must lose.

    Only a very big company would be able to buy Green and Black if its chocolates became very popular. And it would be easier for a company with a cooperative relationship with Green and Black to buy it than a company with a competitive relationship.

    Then, in only six years, sales rose from two million pounds to twenty-two million pounds.

    When Cadbury's bought Green and Black, a lot more people who believed in organic food were very unhappy. But William Kendall was very happy, because he had made a lot of money and his plan had worked.

    He had involved a very big company in his business from the start, and they were very willing to take over the business when it made a lot of money.

    Teresa Graham said in the most successful businesses, all the people at the company feel they are part of the plan. Everyone understands what the company is trying to do and everyone believes what they do helps the company achieve its goals.

    She says this is really important and one of the reasons for their success.

    But how do you get everyone in the company to feel that they are an important part of the company's plans? You can't just tell people what the plan is and expect them to follow the plan. If you tell people your plan for your business, Teresa Graham says only some people will follow the plan. The best employees will not follow the plan.

    She says businesses need to involve everyone in the company in the discussion and creation of their plans. She says the way to make sure everyone plays their part in achieving the company's goals is to make sure everyone takes part in creating the plans.

    Everyone needs to understand how what they do helps the company achieve its goals, and everyone needs to have personal goals, which they believe in and are connected to the company's goals. When everyone knows what the company is trying to do, and everyone is excited about helping, the company has lots more power.

    This only happens when people feels they played a a part in developing the company's plans.

    </NOT SO IMPORTANT>

    William Kendall has something similar, but different, to say about the role of the company's leaders in managing people. He says the company's owners need to give their managers lots of freedom. He says the company's owners need to find skilled managers and let them do their job the way the managers want to.

    The owners shouldn't be telling their managers how to do their job. The owners have to concentrate on growing the business, and thinking about how the company can develop new plans, not about how people should be carrying out the plans the company has already developed.

    When William Kendall first was a businessman at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, he said they made many mistakes. He said they tried to do everything themselves. Later he said they brought in a group of skilled managers to do marketing, production and administration at the company. This took pressure off the owners and they could spend their time thinking of what the company should do next.

    He says managers should not be given too much freedom, but he also said sometimes too much freedom is better than too little freedom.

    He says at the New Covent Garden Soup Company he learned how to give people a lot of freedom, but not too much freedom. The problem is getting everyone in the business excited about reaching the company's goals and making sure they only do what they are supposed to do to at the same time. The business's employees need to be motivated, but they also need to be controlled.

My ideas become more clear as the time approaches. My ideas are clearest when I'm doing the activity.

    Bean: Now he is a farmer selling his organic food in local markets. He is making a lot less money than he was before leaving his company. I guess he has so much money that he doesn't need to worry if his organic farm is not making much money.
    
    I think I am getting better at planning. But I don't know what to do to reach my goal. Kendall had a good idea, or could recognize good ideas before other people recognized them. Google had a good idea. I have good ideas but I cannot turn them into things people want to do.

    Graham: Tell me about your goals with the two-person discussion competition.
    Bean: One goal is to get the students to speak English rather than Chinese. Their grade depends on their understanding their partner's information and their partner not understanding their information. If they realize this, they might decide to use English there rather than Chinese, because their partner doesn't understand English well. It will confuse their partner.
    Another goal is to develop a language learning game that is like a conversation. If one player beats another player, we know the first player's English is better.

    I want to do the same thing with English teaching. I want people to get excited about learning English, which most people think is not exciting. I want to be as successful as he was planning the growth of his business.
