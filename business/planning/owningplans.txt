Businesses which grow fast always have good plans and good business planning processes. This has been identified as one of the main reasons for their success. The best business get all the people in the business excited about the plan and make sure everyone feels the company's goals are their personal goals.

You can't impose a plan on people and expect them to get excited about it and to follow it.  Everyone needs to know what the goal of the company is and to be excited about having a role in reaching that goal. That only happens when everyone feels they themselves are creating the goals of the company and new goals for themselves, at the same time. It doesn't happen when people feel they are just following someone else's goals.
