    A: His parents were successful farmers. And his first jobs were as a lawyer and banker, but he decided he was more interested in business. At the New Covent Garden Soup Company, he became CEO, and sales went from 3 million dollars to 30 million dollars. He wanted to leave, but no-one wanted to buy the company. They knew they could not run the business as well as he did.
    B: Organic food had been only eaten by a few people, but he saw his company's organic soups and Green and Black Chocolates were becoming very popular. This interested him. He thought organic food made people feel close to the source of their food. He decided to buy the organic Green and Black Chocolates from Craig Sams and try marketing it to not just people interested in organic food, but everyone.
    C: At the soup company, he learned that he must cooperate relationship with a large company so that he can sell his company easily after it is successful and he wants to leave. So he got a big chocolate company to invest in 5 percent of his company. This made believers in organic food unhappy. When he sold all his shares to Cadbury's, many were suprised and very unhappy.
    D: Teresa Graham said everyone needs to feel they own the business's plan by being involved in its creation. Kendall says something different: The business's owners need to give their managers freedom to do things their way. The owners have too much to think about, and don't have time to do their managers' work too. The owners should be thinking about planning the next move.

      \textbf{Graham}: How clear are your plans?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: They are very clear. I want to develop an on-line system to show students their grade now, not just at the end of the semester.\\
      \textbf{Graham}: Seems pretty clear.\\

    B: |
      \\
      \textbf{Graham}: Do you keep your plans up-to-date? Do you show them to people and see what they think?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: Yes, when I develop a new teaching technique, I plan changes to the software, so students can see their grades on the new activity. I tell them about my plans with the software.
    C: |
      \\
      \textbf{Graham}: Are other people involved in your planning? Or do you plan by yourself and then announce your plans?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: I am the only person writing the software. The students are not involved. I would like to get them involved so we plan the system together, but at the moment we are not.

      \\
      \textbf{Graham}: What do you think of William Kendall and organic food?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: He was very good at planning and changing his plans as a result of information. I think I am good at planning and flexible like him.

    identifier: Organic business
    A: Organic food is food grown without farm chemicals. Only a few people liked organic food and organic farmers and business people never made much money. Sams was one of those organic businessmen. From the age of 21, he only ate brown rice and vegetables. Now, however, he and Kendall have become rich by selling organic products. Kendall thinks many people with money don't like modern life and cheap, packaged modern supermarket foods. They want a closer connection with the production of the food they eat. If it's more expensive, it's OK.
    D: Kendall's wife inherited a farm, so he became involved in farming again. Many people changed their views about organic food after Mad Cow's Disease. He changed his views too, and he made his own farm an organic farm. Prince Charles may have influenced him. He made his farm organic after visiting the prince's farm.
    C: Sams' products never had any sugar. Sams thinks sugar is poison. But after a visit to Belize with Fairley and trying the chocolate, they started selling organic chocolate, which is 30\% sugar. Fairley has an expensive lifestyle and loves chocolate. She convinced Sams to sell organic chocolate. The chocolate became very popular. But Sams and Fairley couldn't get enough investment to build the company fast enough. Kendall offered to buy a 75\% share in the company, and the company grew 50\% each year. Sams continued as president of the company.
    B: Prince Charles thinks the old life-styles are better. He is worried about climate change and economic development. He doesn't believe in Western medicine. Everyone thought he was mad twenty to thirty years ago, when he bought a farm and made the farm completely organic. Now his farm makes fifty million pounds a year. More and more people started believing in organic food. The organic food market is now worth two billion pounds each year in England. William Kendall was one of the farmers who went to the Prince's farm and learned about organic farming.
