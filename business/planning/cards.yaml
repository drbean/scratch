      \textbf{Graham}: What would William Kendall think? What is the lesson of organic food?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: The lesson is marketing and making something popular. I need to get lots of other teachers doing the CompComp activity. I'm sure Kendall would think the CompComp is not a good idea. He would think it would be hard to sell.
    B: |
      \textbf{Graham}: Tell me about your plans for the CompComp activity?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: I think conversation is cooperative and competitive at the same time. I want the students to try to understand more of their partners' information than their partners' understand of theirs.
      \textbf{Graham}: I'm not too sure what you mean. I don't understand.\\
    C: |
      \textbf{Graham}: Do the students understand what you are trying to do with the CompComp activity? Are you changing your plans depending on the students' reactions.\\ 
      \textbf{Bean}: Some understand, but a lot don't. It's difficult showing them what I want to do. I don't think they want to compete. But I won't give up. I will stick to my plan even if the students don't understand.
    D: |
      \textbf{Graham}: Are the students involved in the planning of your CompComp activity? Or do you plan by yourself and then announce your plans?\\
      \textbf{Bean}: The activity is my idea. I would like the students to take ownership of the activity and we work together to decide which direction to go. But that hasn't happened.
