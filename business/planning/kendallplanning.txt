William Kendall is a successful businessman who became very good at planning ahead. When he owned a business called Covent Garden Soup Company, he found it very difficult to sell it. That was because everyone thought he was a very good businessman. They thought if they bought the company, they wouldn't do as well as him running it. So they thought it would not be a good idea to buy it.

Therefore, when he started at his next company, Green and Black Chocolates, he immediately started thinking about how to sell it. He went to a very big chocolate company, Cadbury's and asked them if they would like to invest ten percent in the company. They did. And now Cadbury's has bought all of his company. That was his plan.
