Businesses never stop learning new things. The people who run businesses should never stop learning. Business plans may or may not need to change with that new learning. The hard work that goes into creating a business plan will be repaid again and again, if the plan is constantly held in mind. the plan should not be regarded as a boring thing that you create only because other people, for example, your bank or shareholders, want to see it.

The plan you have written down can be shown to many different people whenever they want to see a business plan. So the hard work writing down the business plan also should not be regarded as a waste of time. It can be reused many times.
