      A: You need to think about what your are doing. Keep your mind on the job, not on the weekend. And have your own goals. How can you achieve those goals? Try to achieve those goals. If the job is bad, make it a good job. If that seems impossible, change jobs.
      B: Try to get other people involved in your work. Help others, and they will help you. This doesn't mean to take the easy way. No. Accept challenges. But be prepared for failure. Be happy when you fail. It's great then, when you succeed. But be organized about it. Have a plan for each day.
      C: Try to learn more skills. And study on the weekend, or at night. And talk a lot with the boss. Let the boss know what you think. If you want something from him/her, ask. But think carefully about what you're doing all the time. How could you do it better? Why are you doing what you're doing?
      D: Be organized. Have a plan for each day. Write something down to look at and see how you're going, today, this month, this year. And get together with others from the company after work.
