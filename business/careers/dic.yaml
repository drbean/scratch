    What's important, I think, is to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Also, get to know your co-workers and do things with them after work and on the weekends. Get together not just with people in the same office, but with workers in other parts of your company too.

    All this is a lot of work, so you need to have a life outside work. You need to spend time with your family. Have a good time with them, so that you can come back to work feeling good. This will help you do a good job at the company.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Keep that in mind.

    But have your own goals. Your goals are different than your company's goals. Do you want to be doing the same thing for the rest of your career? Think also about what kind of work you want to be doing in the future and think about what you have to do to get that kind of work.

    If you're unhappy with your present job, don't just accept it and keep on working in the job, even though you don't like it. Find ways to make the job a better job in your eyes. If you can't make the job a better job, look for a new job.

    Don't think of your job as something just you do. You are part of a team. Your success depends on what the other people in your team do too. Make sure other people understand that their success depends on what you do too. If they know you are working for them, this will make it easier for you to get them to work for you.

    Be dissatisfied if things are too easy. Prefer to do the difficult thing. Solving a difficult problem, or surviving a difficult situation is very satisfying. But, be prepared for failure and learn from that failure. Try something different and achieve something great.

    It's also important to be organized. You need to have a plan. You need to know what to do each day. Have something you can look at to see how you are going today, this month and this year. When you look at this plan, do you see that things are going according to the plan? Or is the plan completely meaningless?

    Try to better yourself all the time. There is always some skill you can learn for your job and how to do it better. If the company offers you training, take the training. You can study too, part-time at colleges in the evening or weekend, and by reading. Be a life-long learner.

    Talk to your boss. Let management know what you think. If you want something, ask for it. They may not give it to you, but perhaps they will negotiate with you for something less. A raise which is smaller than you wanted is better than no raise at all.

    What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Understand what you are doing.

    Fast-Track is looking for a new Sales Manager for its subsidiary in Poland. It intends to appoint someone from within the company. Recent sales in Poland have been poor. Sales representatives are not motivated and staff turnover is high.

    The successful candidate will be expected to increase sales and manage the sales team so it is more motivated. He or she will be a natural leader and energetic, confident and outgoing. He or she will also 

    1. have had a successful career as a sales representative, 
    2. have organizational and interpersonal skills.
    3. good academic background,
    4. administrative ability,
    5. knowledge of English, Polish and other languages.

    Barbara is Polish and thirty years old. She finished secondary school and has a diploma in marketing. She has worked as a Fast-Track sales representative since leaving school. She has a good knowledge of computing. She has had the best sales results of the Fast-Track Polish sales team in the last five years.

    She speaks Polish and Russian very well. She has a good English vocabulary, but she is not very fluent.

    During the interview, she appeared to have a very strong personality. She was energetic and confident. But sometimes she appeared aggressive. We have doubts whether she will be a good team player.

    Tadeusz is Polish and he is fifty-two years old. He has a university degree in engineering. He has wide experience in a variety of industries. He joined Fast-Track five years ago as regional manager for the south of Poland. He has been fairly successful in increasing sales by twelve percent over the five-year period he has worked for Fast-Track.
    He speaks fluent Polish and English.
    During the interview he appeared very calm and relaxed. He moves and talks slowly, but is a hard worker. He is not creative but he is happy to get ideas from the other creative members of a team. All current staff think he is practical and reliable.

    Eva is German and aged forty-two. She has a university degree in history. She has worked for over fifteen years as a sales representative in Germany, the U.S. and Poland. She joined Fast-Track a year ago. She has had a good sales record in all her previous jobs. In her first year with Fast-Track, her sales results have been satisfactory.
    She speaks fluent German, English and Polish.
    During the interview, she appeared quiet, but also strong. She was rather nervous at the interview. She might be good at team-building, but would probably be too dependent on other people. She likes administration, but doesn't appear to have many ideas about the future of the company.

    Barbara: What's my aim? Well, to be honest, I would like to get to the top as soon as I can. I'm very ambitious. And if I get the job, I don't see why I couldn't become a director in a few years' time. That's what I really want.

    I applied for the job because I think I've got a lot to offer. I'm competitive and I like to win. I know a few people think I'm difficult to work with. Maybe that's true. But I get results. That's the main thing.

    Tadeusz: I want to do a good job for the company. I think we should expand slowly over the next five years. We're in a very competitive market, so I won't take too many risks. I think we could increase our market share in the long term, but we must be patient and realistic.

    I feel I have the ability and experience to do this job. I'm a 'safe pair of hands,' as they say. People respect me because I have good judgement.

    Eva: If you choose me, I'll start by improving our sales team. I want people to enjoy working in our sales department. Everyone in the team must help each other, and help me as much as possible. That way, we'll get good results.

    I've got a lot of sales experience, and I've always been successful wherever I've worked, especially during the past year. I think I could lead a team well. I'm the head of our local business club, and I like organizing people and telling them what to do. I'm a very fast learner. I'd enjoy going on a training course to help me do the job better.

    Dr Bean: I tried very hard to motivate the sales team. But frankly they were very poor sales people, and they did a very bad job. I was unable to get them to enjoy selling Fast-Track material, although I tried very hard, setting up various systems to allow them to see the results of their efforts.

    I don't know, perhaps it's because I don't have any sales experience, myself. Or perhaps it was because of my personality. I'm not confident or outgoing. And, although I enjoyed administration of the team, it was very difficult because I don't know any Polish.

  - tips
  - Which tips do the candidates believe in?
  - business
  - A
  - |+
    In the first four weeks, we studied 10 pieces of advice, or things to think about when you have a job. Those 10 tips were: 1. The plan. Have a schedule. 2. Think! Keep your mind on what you're doing. 3. Teamwork. Get others in your team to help you do your job. 4. Continue studying. Learn while away from the job. 5. Togetherness. Get together with co-workers outside work. 6. My way. Create your own goals.  7. Be ambitious. Do things the hard way. 8. Talk to the boss. Tell him or her what you want. 9. Get a life! Take time to relax on the weekends. 10. Change your job! If you can't make your job a better job, get a new job.
    In the exam, each person will have information about what one of the four candidates, Barbara, Tadeusz, Eva and Dr Bean do and believe in. You will have to tell your partners what you know, and find out from them what they know. You will then have to answer 5 questions, What do 4, 3, 2, 1, or none of the candidates do or believe in.
    For example,
            On A's card, it says Barbara tries to do difficult things, and studies how to do them after work. She has her own goals.
            On B's card, it says Tadeusz gets his team to help him to do things, which they do the hard way, but he rests with his family on the weekend.
            On C's card, it says Eva believes the difficult way is the best way, but gets others to work with her, and she has her own goals.
            On D's card, it says Dr Bean makes easy work hard, sets his own goals, and relaxes with family on the weekend.
    So, all four people believe in 7. Be ambitious. Three people believe in 6. My way. Two people believe in 9. Get a life! One person believes in 4. Continue studying. And no-one believes in 1. The plan.

  - Thinking about your career--Would you be a good candidate?
  - business
  - all
  - |+
    First, we looked at ways to think about your career. For example, is it important to talk much with the boss about our dreams and ambitions? Should we get together with people in other parts of the company? Next we compared three candidates for a new sales manager position. We had to think whether the candidate would be a good leader and good administrator.

    What is the relationship between these two exercises? The issues are ones that you face together when you think about your position and decide it is not satisfying.

    Companies want new employees who have thought about their career and who have tried to improve it. However in interviews, it is difficult for both interviewer and interviewee to talk about this. Our mental lives are private.

    Sometimes the best candidate will fail to get the job, and a weaker candidate will be chosen. But it is our inner self which finally determines what kind of career we have, rather than the people or society around us.
