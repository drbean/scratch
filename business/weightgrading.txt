Grading in the course is divided into homework, classwork and exams. 

The homework is 20 percent of the grade. Each week 0, 1 or 2 points will be given, depending on how many words of the soundfile you were able to write down.

Classwork is another 20 percent of the grade. Each week I will award points for groups whose members give answers to exercises from the book, ask me questions, and use English during discussions.

Exams are 60 percent of the grade. We do 4 exams in week 4, 9, 13, and 18. Each exam is worth 15 percent of the grade. You have to be here in those weeks.
