    Nick: My wife has worked for the same company for the past 19 years as a manager.

    Over this time she has made several suggestions to her immediate manager who has either ignored them or taken them to the directors and suggested them as his own, thus taking all the credit.

    My wife has finally decided that as her ideas and suggestions are either ignored or stolen, she will resign.

    Is there anything she could do beforehand?

    Debbie: I want my boss to tell people that I first thought of the idea. I want people outside the company to know that it was my idea.

    Nigel: Women often suffer from this kind of treatment.

    But look on the bright side - she and her ideas are obviously valued. It's the credit she's missing.

    One solution would be to put things down in writing, and also to arrange meetings to talk about specific proposals and ideas.

    This could be done in a spirit of cooperation, emphasizing her desire to collaborate with her boss for the sake of the company.

    She could request a review meeting at which each of them tells the other what they should do to give each other better support.

    This would give her the opportunity to say that she would like more recognition.

    Brian: Debbie's ideas are not hers. They are the company's. Everything she does at the company belongs to the company. It's not important who produces the ideas. What is important is that the company owns the ideas and the work of all the employees of the company. That is what the company is paying its employees for. Their work and their ideas.

    So I am not willing to recognize who produced the ideas and to give credit to those people, whether they are men or women. If I recognize them, they will think that they own the ideas and that they can take them and sell them.

    Nigel: Employees often feel they own their ideas, but companies may have the rights to both them and their work sometimes.

    One solution would be for the company to clearly state its policy on the ownership of the ideas of its employees and to talk to employees about this policy.
    
    This could be done in a spirit of recognition of the worth of employees' ideas.

    If the company did this, it would be able to distinguish the ownership and origin of ideas, two concepts which are now confused.

    Then there could be explicit feedback and recognition of good ideas. Widespread recognition of good ideas would encourage greater contribution of ideas by all employees.

    You are Charles, the chief executive of a camping equipment company in France. Jacques is your production manager. He is responsible for making the tents and other equipment that your company sells. Todd is your marketing manager. He is responsible for selling your products. The marketing department is very successful, partly because Oliver, one of Todd's sales representatives is a very good salesman. You like both Oliver and Todd. But Oliver and Todd are fighting. You agree Oliver is a difficult employee, but you have been friends with him for years. He is very valuable to the company. You'd like to keep Oliver happy if possible, and to find ways to deal with the situation. The sales from his area amount to twenty-four percent of the business's total sales.

    Oliver: I've been thinking a lot recently, Todd. I think you probably know, I'm not happy here at all. And I feel I've got to do something about it.
    Todd: Really? What exactly is the problem?
    Oliver: I think you know it, Todd. Jacques let me down badly with that order. He just wouldn't make any effort for me, so we've lost the order. It means I don't get the commission, and it'll also affect my bonus.
    Todd: Oliver, you must understand. You can't promise a customer that we'll deliver in three weeks. It's a busy time at the moment. Jacques's working under a lot of pressure.
    Oliver: Maybe, but let's face it. Jacques's no good as a production manager. He can't deal with pressure. He just says, Sorry I can't help. But it's not just Jacques..
    Todd: Oh yes?
    Oliver: Well, to be honest, I'm not happy with the way you run the department.

    Todd: I'm listening.
    Oliver: The trouble with you is, you always want to know where I am, every second of the day. You give me no space. You want to control me all the time. How can I meet my sales targets if I have to spend all the time writing reports, answering your telephone messages and attending meetings? I've got to be out there selling, twenty-four hours every day.
    Todd: Maybe, but you can't just do what you like, when you like, Oliver. Discipline is important.
    Oliver: Discipline! Control! Look, I've had enough. I've give everything to this company. But no one cares. So, I've decided to resign. You'll get my letter in the morning and I'll send a copy to Charles. He won't be pleased, I'm sure. We've been friends for years. But I just can't work with you Todd. There's no other solution.

    You are Todd, the marketing manager of the camping equipment company. Oliver is a very good salesman. But he doesn't listen to you. You want Charles to punish Oliver. You tell Charles that Oliver spends too much money on entertainment and expensive gifts for his customers. He also has not introduced you to the biggest buyers in his area. He says the buyers are too busy to meet you. But you think his plan is to leave the company, join a different company and get the buyers to switch to his new company's products. You want to get to know the buyers to make sure that Charles doesn't take his buyers with him. Oliver also ignores your phone messages and does not write sales reports.

    On Friday, last week, Charles, C.E.O. of the camping goods company, told Olivier it was okay to accept a large order from Carrefour for camping goods, The goods had to be delivered in two weeks. Charles knows that it is almost impossible for his company to deliver the goods. But he wants the money.

    When Jacques, the Production Manager, heard about the Carrefour order, he complained to the Sales Department. He told Todd that he cannot produce the goods in two weeks, because now is the busiest time of the year for the production department. He asked Todd who okayed the order.

    Olivier is the Sales Department's best salesman. He is very sorry for Jacques because the Production Department cannot handle the Carrefour order. Charles, the C.E.O., is Olivier's friend, and he asked Olivier to take the order. Olivier is under a lot of pressure from Charles to increase sales.

    Todd, the Sales Manager, asked Olivier why he took the order from Carrefour. Todd knows the Production Department is very busy now. Olivier tells him Charles told him it was okay to take the order. Todd is unhappy Olivier did not ask him. He is also mad at Charles for okaying the order. He wonders what he should tell Carrefour.

    On Friday, last week, Charles, CEO of the camping goods company, found that the production department was working on a large order from Carrefour for camping goods, This surprised him because the company had never before produced goods for Carrefour. He asked Todd, his sales manager to investigate.

    Todd asked Jacques about the large Carrefour order. Jacques said he didn't know anything. He said perhaps Olivier got the Carrefour order. Todd told Jacques that it wasn't Olivier's order. Jacques then asked Todd not to tell Charles. He said he would give Todd half the money that Carrefour was paying him for the goods.

    Todd asked Olivier about the Carrefour order Jacques was working on. Olivier said that Charles had already talked to him about it. He said he was as surprised and as unhappy as Charles. He said that he had taken Carrefour buyers to dinner and had bought them presents many times, but they had never given him one order. 

    Upset by the news, Todd told Charles it was impossible that he not know about orders that the production department was working on. He told Charles that either Olivier or Jacques must be stealing from the company. He asked Olivier. Olivier was as mad as him. Todd decided Jacques was the bad man.

    You are the C.E.O. of the company. Olivier is your friend. He is a very good salesman. You wanted him to be marketing manager of your company, but he refused. He doesn't like being a manager. He doesn't like working in an office. He likes to go out and have fun with buyers and try to get their orders.

    Because Olivier wouldn't be marketing manager, you gave Todd the job. He knows a lot about sales and marketing. But he has a bad relationship with Olivier. You think you might fire Todd, because Olivier is your friend and the company's best sales representative.

    Sometimes you have a bad relationship with Olivier, but it is not always bad. Usually it is good. It is only bad when he has an important order you can't work on. A lot of the orders you produce in the Production Department come from Olivier, so you see him a lot. Olivier never says bad things to you about Todd.

    But you know Olivier and Todd don't have a good relationship with each other. When you have a problem, you go to see Todd. Then Todd always says bad things to you about Olivier. You know Todd is jealous of Olivier's sales ability.

    You don't like Olivier. You are his boss, but he makes more money than you do, because he is a super-salesman. The company pays him twenty percent of the money it makes from each order. So he makes a lot of money.
    
    You are jealous of his ability as a salesman. You try to prevent him selling so much by not giving him any freedom. You criticize him for his car accident and for his entertainment expenses. You ask him to to go to unnecessary meetings, write unnecessary reports and telephone you all the time. You want him to leave the company.

    Charles is your friend. You have been working with him since he set up his company 12 years ago. But you aren't head of your department. You are not interested in being a manager. You love visiting buyers and getting orders from them, as a sales representative.

    Your manager is Todd. He has been only working for the company for two years, You don't want to be sales manager, and take Todd's job from him. But Todd is afraid of you. He tries to control you by making you go to meetings, write reports and tell him everything you are doing.
