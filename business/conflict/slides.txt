## The unexamined life is not worth living--Socrates

What should be your aim living life, working?

To make money, OK.

But also, to examine your actions and thoughts
and OTHERS' actions and thoughts.

## Aim of conflict session

- To get you to think like a mediator/facilitator (helper) of negotiation.
- Help people make good decisions about their actions when there is conflict.

## Conflict in the company

A controlled community where we spend a large part of our lives.

Management/the bosses have the power

but 

Labor/the workers have the numbers

## Conflict between individuals

## Conflict between companies

One company thinks the other company isn't living up to the contract.

## Same question, applied to this class

- Dr Bean is a manager.
- The students are the workers.

In what areas is there conflict between Dr Bean and the students?

# The framework

## making a bigger pie OR dividing the pie

Is there an opportunity to create value as well as distribute value

Is it a zero-sum game? OR a win-win situation

You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.

OR

I win, you lose.

## cooperative <-> competitive

- cooperative <-> competitive
- Creating value <-> distributive
- win-win situation  <-> zero-sum game

(everyone wins) (you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours)

## Communication: Empathy OR assertiveness

Is communication good?

- Do the 2 speakers express empathy for the other speaker?
- Do the 2 speakers assert the rightness of their position?

## Principal OR agent

- Is the speaker acting in the place of someone else? Is the conflict their own conflict?
- Or are they like a spokesperson representing someone else in the conflict?

## 朝三幕四

[Monkeys get 4 & 3 instead of 3 & 4](http://www.chinapage.com/story/monkeyfeed.html)

Analyze the story in terms of the cooperative-competitive dimension and empathy-assertiveness dimension.

## Role play--the champions

[Debtor role play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmP1GMdm47g)
00:15

The first champion spent a lot of money on their credit card and now cannot pay.
The second champion is a bank officer, requesting the first champion to say how they will pay.

Role play the discussion.

## Role play--the spokespersons

The 2 spokespersons say:

1. Something the champions said.
2. What the listeners thought.
3. In terms of the framework, whether the champions were:
	
	a. concerned about expanding the pie, or dividing the pie.
	b. good communicators, showing empathy &/or assertiveness.
	c. negotiating for people not at the table (ie stakeholders.)

Dr Bean will listen to the spokespersons and choose the winners.

During the _____(1), both sides focused _____(2) on claiming as _____(3) a slice as possible of what they saw as a _____(4) pie. They often exhibited a _____(5) mindset, and negotiated as if whatever _____(6) the other party gained must necessarily _____(7) themselves. The exclusive focus on _____(8) gain typically prevents the sharing of _____(9) that can lead to _____(10) the pie. It can also lead to the use of hardball _____(11) and an increase in the _____(12). Each side _____(13) a variety of hard-bargaining _____(14) in the attempt to _____(15) the other.
_____(16) between the two sides was also poor. Pastreich said: “I came to understand how important it was for me to _____(17) to the other side. The musicians were angry with me because they _____(18) I wasn’t even _____(19) to what they were _____(20).

## Which of the 3 dimensions do Olivier and Todd exhibit

- The first speaker (the odd numbered group's speaker) will argue Olivier wants to expand the pie, is empathetic, and the principal and Todd isn't or doesn't.
- The second speaker (the even numbered group's speaker) will argue Todd wants to expand the pie, is empathetic, and the principal and Olivier isn't or doesn't.

* The group will decide which speaker presented the better argument.
* 2 spokespersons (not the speakers) will stand up and report to the class the discussion and the result.
* Before the discussion, I will walk around looking at books. Have you written questions?

## The spokespersons will say:

The 2 spokespersons say:

1. Something the champions said. eg Our champion said Todd wants to help Olivier. He wants to expand the pie
2. What the listeners thought. eg We thought our champion spoke more and did a better job.
3. In terms of the framework, whether the champions were:
	
	a. concerned about expanding the pie, or dividing the pie.
	b. good communicators, showing empathy &/or assertiveness.
	c. negotiating for people not at the table (ie stakeholders.)

Dr Bean will listen to the spokespersons and choose the winners, the group of the spokesperson who gave the best report.

## What kind of person are you?

Do you need to be told what to do?

## Are you a manager, Jack?

Are your subordinates able to work without constant supervision?

## Nicholson and Dr Bean: Who acts according to Theory X and who to Theory Y

A: Nicholson thinks understanding people is important. Nicholson thinks if you know what people want, you can control them. Dr Bean is different than many people and doesn't understand them so well as Nicholson. Dr Bean thinks that it is impossible to control people successfully. Giving orders doesn't work. He wants everyone to have control.

B: 

C: Dr Bean works with just Taiwanese students. He is used to working with them and wants to try a new approach motivating them. He wants to make learning English exciting. Nicholson works with a team of people from many different cultures. He doesn't know them well and they are all different and some are not interested in working. He has to just tell them what to do.

## Nicholson and Dr Bean: Who acts according to Theory X and who to Theory Y

Nicholson: Dr Bean is a great teacher, but I don't think he understands the students. He doesn't recognize them as individuals and what drives them. So he can only appeal to the most basic motivations, like grades and a desire to please the teacher. In my teaching, I recognize everyone is an individual. I have students from Africa in my classes, and although they all have black skin they are just like the European students.

## Nicholson and Dr Bean: Who acts according to Theory X and who to Theory Y

Dr Bean: I try to get students to work in groups, and it only succeeds sometimes. Nicholson just adopts traditional techniques of lecturing, exams and grades. I try to get students to be responsible for their own goals by thinking about what they admire in some particular student's English. Nicholson is just trying to teach students what is in the textbook. I don't know what the students' goals are, but I think if they enjoy talking to each other in English, they might feel successful and want to keep on learning.
