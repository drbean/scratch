    identifier: Uniqlo's marketing mix
    A: Product is what Uniqlo makes, clothes. Uniqlo's aim is not just to make clothes however. It wants to make clothes that people will buy, because the aim of the company is to make money, more than it is to make clothes. It has to decide what clothes people want to buy, ie, what clothes are popular and make those clothes.
    B: Price is how much the customer pays for the clothes. The higher the price, the more money Uniqlo might make, but the less likely the customer are to buy the clothes. Uniqlo also has to know how much the clothes cost to make. Uniqlo products are medium-priced. Uniqlo decided they want to sell to people who want to show they are successful.
    C: Place is where Uniqlo sells its products and the experience the customer has buying the products. Uniqlo controls the places where you can buy Uniqlo clothes. It creates a special Uniqlo atmosphere by running its own stores, and creating special places in department stores. People will think Uniqlo is less fashionable if you can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere.
    D: The purpose of promotion is to keep Uniqlo clothes in people's minds. Promotion includes magazine and TV advertisements. It also includes direct mail to customers. Uniqlo has well-known Japanese musicians endorse its products, the way Michael Jordan endorsed Nike shoes. Promotion also is the style of its public image, the look of Uniqlo stores.
