  - Uniqlo's marketing mix
  - business
  - all
  - |+
    Uniqlo is a Japanese clothing brand. It started as a small men's clothing store in 1949 and is now the biggest Japanese clothing store chain.

    Uniqlo's name has always been connected to the Japanese music scene. Its customers are young and fashionable.

    Uniqlo has developed a unique marketing mix. It has the right combination of product, price, promotion and place.

    If a clothes company wants to be successful, it needs to have the right marketing mix. Every company has a different marketing mix of product, price, promotion and place.

    The product is what Uniqlo sells. The price is how much the customer pays. Promotion is what Uniqlo does to keep Uniqlo in customers' minds. Place is where and how the customer buys Uniqlo clothes.

    The company has to make the right decisions about all of product, price, promotion and place to make the most money. And decisions about each of these things affects decisions about the other things.

    Uniqlo has to design clothes and see if customers like them. But, it also has to know what clothes will be popular in the next six months, in spring or fall, and produce those kind of clothes.

    In the fashion industry, clothes are only fashionable for a short time. Uniqlo has to change the style of its clothes all the time.

    New styles are developed for the spring and fall season. But when one style of clothes is becoming popular, small changes are continually made in the style to keep it popular.

    If these continual small changes are not made, the style can quickly lose popularity.

    Uniqlo has to look at its customers and decide how much they are willing to pay. It also has to decide how much it costs to produce its clothes.

    Uniqlo products are medium-priced. People are willing to pay a little more for them to show they are successful.

    It is not low-priced. The clothes of people who buy low-priced brands show they want value for the price they pay.

    It is not high-priced. People who buy a high-priced brand will buy it, even if it is cheaper, or even if it is more expensive. They want to show they have clothes which are different or the latest style.

    Place is where Uniqlo products may be bought and also the ways the clothes are delivered or distributed to these places.

    Uniqlo controls very carefully the places where its clothes may be bought. It has its own stores, and it has places in department stores, where the customer feels they are in a special Uniqlo store.

    It wants to create an environment where the customer has a unique Uniqlo experience. If people can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere, they don't have that special Uniqlo experience.

    And people will think the Uniqlo brand is less fashionable if they can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere.

    The purpose of promotion is to get customers. Promotion includes advertising in magazines or on TV, and mailing of catalogs and newsletters to customers. It also includes getting famous people to wear Uniqlo clothes, the way Michael Jordan endorsed Nike shoes.

    Japanese rappers Scha Dara Parr wear Uniqlo clothes. They are paid by Uniqlo to endorse the brand.

    Other forms of promotion include discounts, give-away competitions, and participation in public events.

    Promotion also includes the style of its public image, that is, the look of Uniqlo stores, Uniqlo displays, Uniqlo packaging and the Uniqlo logo 

    All these things have an effect on sales of Uniqlo clothes.

    Tokyo's Shinagawa train station is one of the most crowded places on earth. Close to a million commuters will transit here on an average day.

    Not your usual location for a clothing shop. But the proprietor is no ordinary Japanese apparel maker.

    True to its name, Fast Retailing and its Uniqlo stores are on a breathtaking dash to the top. With their conventional stores already saturating the country, the company is now chasing potential customers too busy to visit a regular shop, selling cheap undergarments to busy commuters, just like newspapers and candy.

    Craft: Uniqlo is a retailing legend here in Japan, its no-nonsense, low-cost socks and shirts a mainstay of Japanese closets. Now the company has vowed to make itself as much a household name overseas as it is here in Japan.

    Otoma: Our long-term ambition is to become the world's top apparel company by 2020.

    Craft: That means boosting net sales from around ten billion dollars now to more than sixty billion in just a decade.

    Bold words from a company that's still well behind global names like H&M, Zara and Gap, but typical for Japan's most celebrated entrepreneur right now, Tadashi Yanai. 

    Since he took over the company in 1984, Yanai has transformed Uniqlo into Asia's biggest apparel company, and become Japan's richest man in the process, as diminuitive in stature as he is brimming with confidence.

    Yanai: Our imitators will just stimulate overall demand. We are number one, by far. Our competitors are effectively just advertising our products for us.

    Craft: Yanai's rag trade exploits have made him a business guru here.

    Yamamoto: He's right. There are plenty of mistakes, but never takes risks that endanger his core business. That's the secret of his success.

    Craft: Within the conservative, cloistered and risk-averse circles of Japanese apparel makers, Yanai is cut from different cloth.

    Yamato: A bit like a dictator probably, because no-one, as you said, no other Japanese retailer has done such a thing. No one has achieved such fast growth in the apparel industry. And their style is different from traditional Japanese companies. 

    Craft: Yanai was the first Japanese clothing retailer to knock out middlemen, and adopt Western-style manufacturing and sales. By consolidating design, logistics and marketing under one roof, Yanai was able to reap high margins that fueled the blistering pace of growth throughout the recent downturn.

    Larke: Uniqlo has built itself, its main core, competitive advantage is volume. So, the more stores they can open (obviously, getting the right locations and maintaining the marketing), the better they're going to go forward.

    Larke: I mean, they're talking about selling literally millions of units in any particular season. And most of the other companies, even the global companies, aren't thinking along those lines.
    Craft: Uniqlo isn't really in the same business as the world apparel leaders it seeks to unseat. Instead of disposable instant fashion aimed at the young and trendy. Uniqlo seeks to woo young, old, and fashion-challenged alike with unglamorous, but essential well-made basics priced to sell.
    These super-thin, heat-conserving garments called HEATTECH, were developed in an unusual collaboration with Toray, a leading chemical company. Such high-tech materials undergird Yanai's strategy for building a global brand. Projected sales for HEATTECH underwear this season? A whopping seventy million units.

    Yanai: People tend to assume underwear has to be made from cotton. that synthetics are better than natural fibers. It has a lot of potential. I want to show this to the world. Our marketing strength and Japanese technology is a winning combination.

    Hello and welcome to the Smart Method Podcast, where you can listen to the audio versions of some of my blog posts, along with interviews I will conduct on marketing, culture, smart design. Visit my blog at rolandsmart.com, to learn more and access links and resources mentioned in these posts.

    January 19, 2009. Where marketers are today:

    For those who have studied marketing, you’ll recall the 4 P’s:, Product, Price, Placement and Promotion.

  - Who manages the 4 P's?

  - |+
 
    Today, however, three out of four of those P’s have often been usurped by other parts of the organization. Product is often managed by a research and development, or product development, group. Price is often set by the sales team, or in some cases by customers. Placement is within the purview of the distribution arm, which leaves marketers with Promotion.

    Now, Promotion is often interpreted by other departments as "making it pretty" or is at the service of the sales organization.

    To make matters worse, organizations are siloed so these different internal organs are not well coordinated or even on the same page. With increasing pressure to demonstrate ROI metrics around Promotion, marketers are less empowered and less able to bring value to their organizations.
    
    At the same time, the context in which they are operating has become far more complex. New technologies offer new communication channels, and has changed the dynamics of communication.

    Managing the marketing mix, and optimizing it, is increasingly complex. Many traditional marketers not only don’t get the new context, but they are still trying to apply a broadcast framework when they need to adopt a conversational one. This reality has degraded marketing’s reputation within organizations. And, that said, we need marketing more than ever at this moment, and I believe it can bring significant value to these companies.

    First and foremost, marketing needs to be ....

    Interviewer: What do you think is the key to successful marketing?

    Turner: Well, I think, if you're talking about an individual marketer, then, er, I'd be thinking about three broad areas.

    I think firstly, having a really passionate curiosity for the customer--really being prepared to do a lot of hard work to get a deep understanding of their needs, er, their behaviors, and everything that really motivates them.

    Now you've got to get close to them by, yeah, you've got to talk to them, you've got to be meeting them regularly,

    A lot of marketers don't do that.

    But you've also got to be able to do the hard analysis of all the business data and market research and constantly analyzing the data and trends to, er, pick up what's, er going to be affecting them and their behaviors.

    So that's customer closeness, um, and that has to be combined with a really strong business sense, um, an instinctive understanding of how your company makes money. So, the job of a marketer being to match the consumer need we just talked about ...
  - analysis|instinctive|consumer

    ... with a company's assets and capabilities, so that in the end you make some money, you make a profit. Um, if you don't know the numbers, if you don't know what you make and lose money, you won't be successful and your company won't be successful.

    I think the last thing is that, as a marketer, you have to have, um, really great communication skills because you're often responsible for things like profit or pricing, but in reality it's another department that actually controls or delivers it.

    So it could be sales or finance that are actually affecting pricing, even though marketing may be nominally responsible for it.

    So as a marketer, you have to be have great, sort of, influencing skills, communication skills, to get people to understand what's behind the strategies, but also to be motivated to deliver them for, for you and for the company.

    So I think those are the three things--passionate curiosity for the customer, a strong instinctive understanding of how to make money in the business, and really strong communication skills.
