    I am really unhappy with our manager. She never listens to what we say. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.'

    When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.'

    She also never tells us what management's plans are. If she told us more, we would feel less stress.

    Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault. 

    We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.

    BDL: I think the best thing to improve the health and well-being of our staff is to improve the food in the company cafeteria. Generally, the food here isn't healthy. If someone just ate the food available in the company cafeteria, they wouldn't be getting a balanced diet. There is too much fatty, salty, starchy and sweet food, and not enough fish, fruit and vegetables.

    And the food here is not good for people's stress levels. You know how drinking coffee or coke can make you feel more tense and excited? That's stress. And research has shown that fatty, salty, starchy and sweet foods also raise people's stress levels.

    To reduce these levels, we need to have more natural foods, like fish, fruit and vegetables, in the cafeteria. Perhaps they don't taste so good as the food we have now, but people will feel more relaxed and will live better lives.

    SLT: To reduce stress here at the company, I think it's important that everyone be involved in a lot of physical activity, like jogging, or swimming, or basketball.

    It would be nice to have our own basketball court and swimming pool, but that would be very expensive.

    Instead, I think we should talk to the manager of the local sports center and arrange a group membership for everyone at the company. That would probably also be expensive, but the sports center has a good pool and a sauna.

    I think a lot of workers would enjoy a swim at lunch time or after work. The sauna is also very relaxing.

    And I'm sure their basketball court would be very popular. Even now, many people here are members of the sports center, and they use the basketball court during the lunch hour or after work.

    They also have a weight room, where people can use exercise machines.

    KED: I think, to improve everyone's well-being and reduce stress at the company, we should have company tours. Every month, we should all go in buses to an amusement park, or climb a mountain and have a picnic.

    Once or twice a year, we should travel to some place of interest, here or overseas, and spend a few days together seeing scenic spots, and having fun.

    As an example, I think it would be fun and relaxing for everyone in the company to go to Korea and go shopping and eat Korean food, and bring back some Korean souvenirs.

    In winter, we could go skiing there. In summer, it would be nice too, because it would be a lot cooler than Taiwan.

    When people are having fun, they can forget about work, and they will come back with good feelings about the company.

    So, my idea is one-day company tours, once a month, and three- or four- day tours, once or twice a year.

  - Cause of stress
  - business
  - A
  - |+
    Stress doesn't usually have only one cause. Usually, there are a number of factors which together result in people feeling stress. A particularly bad combination is where someone is under a lot of pressure, but they also feel that whatever they do has no effect and that they have no support from other people. That combination can cause severe stress and depression. People in that situation often feel helpless. And that's a very bad feeling.

    Bradshaw is a business consultant, and he has a consultancy called In Equilibrium. He helps companies where stress is a problem by identifying the causes of high levels of stress there. He calls this stress risk assessment. The idea is to identify hotspots, areas or people where the risk of stress is high. Perhaps there is a dangerous and unpleasant environment in one part of the company. Or perhaps one manager puts a lot of pressure on workers.

    Besides helping companies understand why there is lots of stress at their companies, Bradshaw also trains managers to do the same kind of thing as he does. He shows them how to become more sensitive to how much stress there is in the company. He teaches them how to listen carefully to their workers. He also gives them the skills to reduce stress. He shows them how different ways of managing workers produce different levels of stress.

    Men and women deal with stress differently. Women tend to report more stress. They talk about their problems. Men don't do this. Women usually cope with stress better. They're better at asking for and and getting support. 

    Men don't like to report stress, because they don't want to appear weak. They don't want people to think they can't do their job. Actually, they are worse at coping with stress. They find it difficult to talk to managers about stress.

    Interviewer: What are the most common causes of stress at work?
    Bradshaw: Well, usually it's a combination of things, er, rather than one cause. Some combinations are worse than others. Er, for example, a very bad combinations is where someone is under a lot of pressure, but they also feel that they have no control and they feel unsupported. That combination can cause severe stress and depression. People in that situation often feel helpless--that nothing they can do will make any difference, and that's a very bad feeling.

    Interviewer: How do you help companies to deal with stress?
    Bradshaw: Well, we help in two main ways: er, firstly by investigating causes of stress, what we call stress risk assessment. The idea of this is to identify problem areas and/or groups, hotspots, where the risk of stress is high. Secondly, we train managers by raising their awareness of stress and giving them skills to prevent and reduce stress at work.

    Interviewer: Do you think that mean and women deal with stress differently?
    Bradshaw: Yes, I do. Er, women tend to, er, report more stress. They talk more, um about their problems. Er, but they usually, in my experience, have better coping strategies. They're better at asking for and getting support, especially from their managers. Men report less stress, in my experience. They don't like to appear vulnerable. And the truth is, they are often more vulnerable and have poor coping strategies. Men are not good at getting support when they need it, and they find it difficult to talk to their managers about stress.

  - CUSP--Control, Uncertainty, Support and Pressure
  - business
  - all
  - |+
    A good working climate is one where stress is largely prevented. With this in mind and in the next three minutes, I would like to provide a brief overview of a critically-important In Equilibrium framework, called the CUSP.

    The CUSP can be used both to prevent stress and to reduce the risks to an individual's health when stress has occurred. The CUSP really is a very useful model, and is based on what we know from thousands of psychological studies and from experience.

    We know that stressful situations, especially those at work, have particular characteristics. Stressful situations tend to be where individuals feel that they have very little control over what is happening.

    They're often high in uncertainty. And they tend to be situations where individuals feel unsupported, or feel that they are receiving the wrong kind of support.

    The way the CUSP works is very simple. The framework suggests that as a manager, if you can do anything to boost someone's sense of control, if you can reduce the level of uncertainty in the situation, or if you can offer support, either directly or facilitated from elsewhere, then that will tend to reduce the level of the pressure impacting on stress risk.

    Hence, the 'C' stands for Control. The 'U' for Uncertainty, the 'S' for Support, and the 'P' for Pressure.

    Enabling control is not about abdicating managerial responsibility. What it is about is encouraging people to take responsibility for their own day-to-day performance. Through for example, effective delegation, applying flexibility, encouraging assertive communication, and consultation within workload.

    The key to reducing uncertainty is timely and effective face-to-face communication. With some other elements to also consider. For example, management and team openness and management approachability. As managers, you are in a unique position to provide both social and practical support to your staff.

    Directly, the message is to always make time for one-to-ones with your staff. Team meetings, listening carefully to comments and difficulties, and always allowing two-way communication. This is your team. You know them best.  You are the best-placed to prevent stress risk and also to pick up problems as they occur. 

    And the CUSP in these latter situations allows a manager to look at practical options in a very structured way for placement within a consulted and agreed action plan.

    Good luck.
