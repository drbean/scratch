My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable. Everything that doesn't go according to management's plan is my or someone else's fault, management says.

That would be okay if I felt like what I did had an effect. But I don't feel like I have any control over what is happening. Nothing I do seems to have an effect. It's a very stressful situation.

It would also be okay if had some freedom to make my own decisions. But none of us are allowed to think for ourselves. Management is always telling us what to do. Everything we do is monitored. We are expected to follow orders blindly.

And management is not supportive. We are not told we are doing a good job. We are only blamed when management is unhappy.

I feel like I am falling off a cliff. I can't take it any more.
