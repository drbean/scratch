I think, to improve everyone's well-being and reduce stress at the company, we should have company tours. Every month, we should all go in buses to an amusement park, or climb a mountain and have a picnic.

Once or twice a year, we should travel to some place of interest, here or overseas, and spend a few days together seeing scenic spots, and having fun.

As an example, I think it would be fun and relaxing for everyone in the company to go to Korea and go shopping and eat Korean food, and bring back some Korean souvenirs.

In winter, we could go skiing there. In summer, it would be nice too, because it would be a lot cooler than Taiwan.

When people are having fun, they can forget about work, and they will come back with good feelings about the company.

So, my idea is one-day company tours, once a month, and three- or four- day tours, once or twice a year.
