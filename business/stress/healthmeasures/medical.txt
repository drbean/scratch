If we are going to improve our staff's well-being, I think we should offer a free medical check-up every year, and bring in consultants, like Alan Bradshaw, to help with the stress levels.

Someone like him could identify stress hotspots in the company and raise managers awareness of stress and train them in ways to reduce the stress they put on their staff, while still making sure that they get the work done. 

We have a company nurse, but she doesn't have the ability to identify causes of stress. I really think we need a professional stress consultant.

The last thing I think which is important to improving staff well-being is the question of smoking. Healthy workers are happy workers. I think it would be a good idea to have a no-smoking policy everywhere in the company.

So, those are my three recommendations: One, free medical check-ups. Two, a stress expert from outside the company. And, three, a no-smoking policy.
