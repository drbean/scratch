## The unexamined life is not worth living--Socrates

What should be your aim living life, working in business?

## Stress of students--Stress of workers

Being a worker is more stressful than being a student.
Teachers don't put as much pressure on students as the boss does on workers.

The performance of the students doesn't hurt the school. But if
workers do a bad job, the boss makes less money.

So, welcome to the world of work.

## Is this class stressful?

I think Dr Bean probably feels more stress than the students.

Imagine it as more stressful (not NUU, but NTU):

1. The class is a turning point in your life
2. You think you might fail.
3. You have problems learning.
4. The environment is very competitive.

## 1. The class is a turning point in your life
    - You really, really want to do well.
    - People are expecting a lot from you here.
    - But if you fail this class, the school kicks you out.
    - And, if you win, you are very popular and become rich.

## 2. You think you might fail.
   - You don't understand what Dr Bean is saying.
   - It's not clear what grades students will get.
   - There is a high failure rate.

## 3. You have problems learning.
   - You have had no success as a learner in the past. But
     now you are making a special effort because this class
     is so important. Unfortunately, ...
   - You have been studying English for 9 years, but still
     can't speak English.
   - You try hard to study but nothing seems to work.
     You can't make yourself learn.

## 4. The environment is very competitive.
   - All the students are worried about their own grades.
   - Many students are unfriendly.
   - A few students try to help, but what they tell you doesn't
     	help.

## Chinese for stress and for pressure

What is the Chinese for pressure?

. . .

- 壓力

- OK, so what is the Chinese for stress?

壓力?

## Pressure and stress are different

- Pressure is a thing, but stress is a feeling.

- Pressure is objective (from outside), but
  stress is subjective (inside).

- Pressure is a cause, stress is a result.

- Pressure is not the only cause of stress.
  Other causes are:
    + Lack of control
    + Uncertainty
    + Lack of support

- Lack of control, uncertainty and lack of support
  are also things from outside. The result of all
  these things is a feeling, stress.

## Good stress--Bad stress

Some stress is good, exciting. Like playing a game,
or watching a movie.

A lot of stress, every day is bad. 

Why?

Because, It's not a game. It's life.

## Man on tightrope

Would you feel stress?
He doesn't feel as much stress as you would. Why?

+ He has the situation under CONTROL. Things are working.
+ There is little UNCERTAINTY about what will happen.
+ He has SUPPORT from others on the mountain.
+ There is not much PRESSURE on him. It's just for fun.

## 3 questions about CUSP and X at NTU

One WH, one YN and one Tag question

+ Why is X afraid of the exam?
+ Is X a good learner?
+ There are few people that can help
+ X, aren't there?
+ X has few people that can help,
doesn't she?

# CUSP

## Pressure from boss

For example, the boss:
i. makes workers do too much work.
ii. controls workers too much, giving
	them no freedom.
iii. is unfriendly and critical of workers.

## Pressure from environment

* Temperature:	Hot/cold
* Noise:		Noisy/quiet
* Space:		Crowded/roomy
* Privacy:	Own space/Shared space
* Facilities, eg computers

## Uncertainty and risk

For example,
	* Job security is low
	* The future is unclear
	* Management doesn't tell labor
	* 	what it plans to do
	* The work environment is not safe
	* Work results are either very good or
	* 	very bad, but it is difficult
	* 	to predict that result.

## Lack of support

The boss and co-workers cannot (or do not) help
with problems. They do not encourage workers.

They don't discuss results with 
the workers who produce the results.

## Lack of control

Workers feel they are not effective. They lack control
over the results of their work.

For example,
1. a marketer tries very hard to sell a product
   but sales are very bad.
2. a researcher tries very hard to develop a new
   process, but is not successful.
3. an entrepreneur tries very hard to raise money
   for a new company, but no one wants to lend
   the company money.
4. Dr Bean tries very hard to teach students, but
   it appears they are unmotivated and learn nothing,

## CUSP framework experiment

Is the CUSP framework a good way of thinking about stress?

Who feels the most stress?

One person (or group) experiences one condition.
The other person (or group) experiences the opposite condition.

For example, I put pressure on X, I don't put it on Y.

After the experiment, X and Y compare the stress they felt. They ask
each other:
Did X feel much stress when Dr Bean put much pressure on them?
Did you feel much stress ... when Dr Bean put pressure on you?
.. when you had control over the question you answered?
.. when you didn't know what question Dr Bean would ask?
.. when you couldn't help each other with the answer?

## Predictions, results

One side of the room (6-8 groups) will predict,
The other side will be experimental subjects.

		Predictors		Subjects
SUPPORT: Groups Black-GreenGreen	Orange-YellowYellow
CONTROL:	Orange-YellowYellow	Black-GreenGreen

## Pressure

Group 1, 2: Asks Dr Bean a question. Dr Bean evaluates the question.

## Stress CompComp

Ask a question about stress experienced by students
and teachers, or about differences in the way men and women
experience stress.

## No use of words, "control", "uncertainty", "support", "pressure"

But your question (or answer) must be about one of these 4 causes of stress.

## 2nd chance

If Dr Bean thinks the question or the answer doesn't fit into one
of the 4 categories, he will give the questioner a 2nd chance.

Grammar will not be a criterion used to judge whether the questioner asks again 
or not, unless Dr Bean can't understand the question (or answer).
