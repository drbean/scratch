    A: |
      So many people have lost their jobs. I am afraid I will be next. Because we work in the Human Resources department, we were responsible for firing those people. Now it is our turn to be fired. It's funny, in a way.
      
      It would be okay if there were less work to do, but with fewer and fewer people here now, there is more and more work to do.
      
      We are under a lot of pressure and there is never enough time to do a good job. In a way, I will be glad when I'm fired. Not really, of course. But, the stress is killing me.
      
      I just can't cope any more. 
    B: |
      My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable. Everything that doesn't go according to management's plan is my or someone else's fault, management says.
      
      That would be okay if I felt like what I did had an effect. But I don't feel like I have any control over what is happening. Nothing I do seems to have an effect. It's a very stressful situation.
      
      It would also be okay if I had some freedom to make my own decisions. But none of us are allowed to think for ourselves. Management is always telling us what to do. Everything we do is monitored. We are expected to follow orders blindly.
      
      And management is not supportive. We are not told we are doing a good job. We are only blamed when management is unhappy.
      
      I feel like I am falling off a cliff. I can't take it any more.
    C: | 
      I can't focus on my work, because of the environment. I don't have my own space. I feel like I'm homeless, living in the street. 
      
      Oh, I have a chair and a desk, but I have to share it. And there are always people I don't know walking past me. It is crowded and there are three other people, all in the same area, without even a window.
      
      It's also very noisy with five telephones always ringing, people shouting, and others interrupting me. 
      
      The computers and the air conditioning are noisy too, when they're not broken. Often it's too hot in the office to work.
      
      And of course, I don't have my own computer. I have to share one with the three other people. I wish they wouldn't download all those files they do. The computer has lots of viruses, of course.
      
      I think I deserve my own office. But I don't get the treatment I deserve from the company, I think.
    D: |
      I, and everyone, else is really unhappy with our manager. We can't talk to her. She never listens to what we say. The only time she talks to us is when she has some new order to give us. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.' It's impossible to have a conversation with her.
      
      She never tries to understand our point of view. When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.' Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. 
      
      I've been patient. We've all been patient, hoping things would change. But the worse the situation the company is in, the worse she has become. She just won't make any effort to see our point of view.
      
      She also never tells us what management is thinking. We have no idea about what management's plans are. If she told us more about what is happening, we would feel much less stress.
      
      Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault and to say other unpleasant things. 
      
      We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.

    A: Steve died 5 years ago in a small plane he was flying solo in the desert. He was not attempting any record. And the flight was not special in any way. After he disappeared, a big search failed to find his body or the plane. His body was found one year later, 5 miles from a big ski resort in the area.
    B: He was flying over a very high mountain, when the plane crashed. Probably, a very strong wind suddenly pushed the plane downwards. The plane, which was 30 years old, was not able to climb quickly enough to get over the top of the mountain, and he crashed, only 90 meters from the top of the mountain.
    C: It probably happened very quickly. He probably thought everything was OK in the plane. But suddenly, in the next few seconds, it was all over. So he felt stress for a very short time. And, there were only 2 sources for the stress that Steve felt. Two out of Lack of Control, Uncertainty, Lack of Support and Pressure

    A: Steve made 6 attempts to fly round the world solo in a balloon. Only the last was successful. On Steve's 4th attempt, there was a fire soon after take-off, but he was able to put the fire out. He continued on. Over the ocean he started going backwards because his team was not good at finding the right height for him to fly at. 
    B: Later, he flew into a thunderstorm. His team told him to fly over the thunderstorm. He went up 9 kilometers into the air. But, the thunderstorm broke the balloon, and it started falling. He thought he would die but was unhurt when the balloon hit the water. The balloon caught fire and sank. He jumped into a life raft.
    C: He was in the water for one night. A rescue plane found him the next morning. A sailing boat picked him up the following night. He was in the water for 24 hours. His team did not help. For his 6th attempt, he had a different, more helpful team. The new team had more experience helping ballooners find good weather.

    A: Ellen set the record for the fastest time around the world alone in a sailing boat. She was on the boat alone but she had a lot of help from a team. The team sent her weather reports. She sent them videos. This interaction meant she was never lonely. She never had time. She was very busy making the boat go fast. 
    B: The boat was very big and very fast. And she had no time to sleep. She never slept for more than an hour, because the wind was very strong and kept changing. She had to make changes to the boat all the time. And she couldn't give up. Because she knew her team and many other people would be disappointed.
    C: The kind of boat that Ellen sailed is very fast, but it also needs to be carefully sailed, because it will turn over if you make a mistake. Two years before Ellen had been on a boat which did turn over after it hit something in the water. She didn't die, but she faced death sailing very fast in very bad weather.

       \item [Plan] Dr Bean thinks A-ho is not a good learner. She doesn't enjoy studying. Dr Bean wants to make A-ho a good learner. He thinks Aho doesn't know if she is going well or badly. He thinks if A-ho understood her progress, she would find learning more enjoyable. He decides to give A-ho some feedback on her learning by putting her grades on the Internet at http://sac.nuu.edu.tw/grades/. He thinks this will motivate A-ho and reduce her stress. He finds writing the web application very relaxing, even though it had lots of bugs. 
       \item [Problem] Dr Bean's grading system is quite complicated and because it is a computer program, there is no paper record to show A-ho. Dr Bean's teaching system is not traditional, and he doesn't know if it is too difficult for the students.  After the course, A-ho asks Dr Bean about her grade. He is surprised by her grade. Dr Bean feels lots of stress. He feels pressure from A-ho. He also feels he can't produce the evidence that will convince A-ho about her grade. He doesn't understand his system, and has forgotten how it works.

It becomes more stressful at the end of the semester before the exam, when she doesn't know what will be on the exam. It is also stressful during the exam, because it is difficult for her to put what she knows into words. After the exam, it is less stressful. She knows whether she did OK or not. But she doesn't know what grade Dr Bean will give her. And that is stressful.
       \item [Failure] A-ho did not understand what Dr Bean wanted her to do, and did the wrong homework. She only got 55. She failed the course. She asks Dr Bean why she failed the course. She is not happy, but she is calm and polite. A number of other students have questions. She tells him it was not clear which website she was supposed to do her homework on.
