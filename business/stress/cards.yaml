    A: |
      So many people have lost their jobs. I am afraid I will be next. Because we work in the Human Resources department, we were responsible for firing those people. Now it is our turn to be fired. It's funny, in a way.
      
      It would be okay if there were less work to do, but with fewer and fewer people here now, there is more and more work to do.
      
      We are under a lot of pressure and there is never enough time to do a good job. In a way, I will be glad when I'm fired. Not really, of course. But, the stress is killing me.
      
      I just can't cope any more. 
    B: |
      My major complaint is the amount of pressure that management is trying to put on me and my co-workers. It's unbelievable. Everything that doesn't go according to management's plan is my or someone else's fault, management says.
      
      That would be okay if I felt like what I did had an effect. But I don't feel like I have any control over what is happening. Nothing I do seems to have an effect. It's a very stressful situation.
      
      It would also be okay if had some freedom to make my own decisions. But none of us are allowed to think for ourselves. Management is always telling us what to do. Everything we do is monitored. We are expected to follow orders blindly.
      
      And management is not supportive. We are not told we are doing a good job. We are only blamed when management is unhappy.
      
      I feel like I am falling off a cliff. I can't take it any more.
    C: | 
      I can't focus on my work, because of the environment. I don't have my own space. I feel like I'm homeless, living in the street. 
      
      Oh, I have a chair and a desk, but I have to share it. And there are always people I don't know walking past me. It is crowded and there are three other people, all in the same area, without even a window.
      
      It's also very noisy with five telephones always ringing, people shouting, and others interrupting me. 
      
      The computers and the air conditioning are noisy too, when they're not broken. Often it's too hot in the office to work.
      
      And of course, I don't have my own computer. I have to share one with the three other people. I wish they wouldn't download all those files they do. The computer has lots of viruses, of course.
      
      I think I deserve my own office. But I don't get the treatment I deserve from the company, I think.
    D: |
      I, and everyone, else is really unhappy with our manager. We can't talk to her. She never listens to what we say. The only time she talks to us is when she has some new order to give us. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.' It's impossible to have a conversation with her.
      
      She never tries to understand our point of view. When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.' Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. 
      
      I've been patient. We've all been patient, hoping things would change. But the worse the situation the company is in, the worse she has become. She just won't make any effort to see our point of view.
      
      She also never tells us what management is thinking. We have no idea about what management's plans are. If she told us more about what is happening, we would feel much less stress.
      
      Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault and to say other unpleasant things. 
      
      We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.
