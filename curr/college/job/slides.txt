# Jobs


## Steps 1-4

- STEP 1: Drs Chang and Bean talk about jobs.
- STEP 1: Students prepare questions to ask, things to say.
- STEP 3: Groups ask their questions.
- STEP 4: Representatives report their discussion.

## STEP 1. Stories by Dr Chang and Dr Bean

What questions do they ask?

What questions do you want them to ask?

Questions like:

- What do you mean by "Did you wear a tie?"
- Sorry, can you repeat the question?
- How do you spell 'lawyer'?

What do they say?

Things like:

"Let me write that down."
"OK, I think I can remember that."

<!-- (Sandra, while we're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
take time out to write on the board things we say so students can ask them 
themselves.

Also we can collect questions from students that they want us to 
ask each other.) -->

## STEP 2. Dr Bean has had a number of jobs in Australia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan. Ask him questions.

2 points: Original Question
1 point: Copy-Cat Question, eg 'Have you been to NY', if someone has already asked,
	'Have you been to Los Angeles.'
An extra point if an Original Question is also grammatically correct.

## STEP 2A. 

- I apprehend bad people and maintain law and order.
- I argue someone's case for people who have problems with the law, or with other people. Often money problems are central.
- I help people in bad health, usually following directions of someone with more knowledge of the problem.
- I keep an eye on money coming in and going out of an organization, and analyze the organization's `health.'
- I put information up so lots of people can have easy access to it on their computers.
- I stand in front of a lot of people, usually younger, and try to get them to understand and acquire skills.

Groups of 2: the people sitting next to each other.

## STEP 3. The 20 questions--What's your job? http://www.tedpower.co.uk/games.htm#g13

[What's my job by English teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILacjy3SPQ)

Notice the use of YN questions.

- Do you work indoors or outdoors? / in a trade or profession? / in a factory or an office?
- Do you work with your hands? Do you wear a uniform? Do you work long hours?
- Do you work from 9-5? Do you work regular hours? Do you work at weekends?
- Do you work with people or machines? Are you in a service industry?
- Do you sell something? Do you earn a lot of money? Must you have good qualifications to do your job?

Write down one question not in this list.

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)
-->

## Step 3A: Questions about jobs

- [Internet ESL Job questions](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=esl+question+jobs&num=100&gws_rd=cr&ei=2QyJVNKeI9je8AWtqoCoBQ)

Write down one question not in this list.

## Grading

A grade for English use during the interviews:

	0: No English
	1: Some English
	2: A lot of English

And a grade for the reports:

	0: Minimal effort made
	1: Effort made, but ineffective
	2: Good report

Drs Chang and Bean will circulate around the classroom to keep an eye on the
uncooperative groups and praise the effective groups.

 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

The interviewers report something their partners do or do not do.

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## STEP 2-4 AGAIN 

(with a different partner)

Do it again with the roles swapped.

<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to speak with different people, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)
