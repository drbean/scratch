    00:28 Will: You brought this misery on us, Locksley.
    Robin: This is Nottingham, trying to divide us.
    Will: We are divided, rich boy. I'm not as blind as that old man over there. You're still trying to be lord of the manor. I heard today that the sheriff now values your neck at five hundred gold pieces. I say we take him in!
    Robin: Will, do you think that the sheriff will give everything back after I'm gone?
    Will: They'll give us the reward and our pardons.
    Robin: Wrong. He'll stretch your necks one by one.
    Will: Well, what will you have us do? Fight armored men on horseback with rocks and our bare hands?
    Robin: If needs be. But with the one true weapon that escapes you, Will. Courage.
    Wulf: Look out!

    Robin: Thank you, Wulf.

    You wish to end this? You wish to go home? Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves!  And face that the price worth may be dear. But I for one would rather die and spend my life in hiding. The Sheriff calls us outlaws, but I say we are free! And one free man defending his home is more powerful then ten hired soldiers. The Crusades taught me that. I will make you no promises, save one: That when you truly believe in your hearts that you're free then I say we can win!

    This is the story of Robin Hood. You can read along with me in your book. You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this. Let's begin now.
    Long ago, England was ruled by the wicked, greedy Prince John. He ordered the Sheriff of Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.

    01:59
    One day, Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn't notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest --- the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see Little John and Robin Hood watching from a tree. "Look at all that gold. Hey! Little John, let's pay Prince John a little visit! In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject. "Gold... beautiful gold! Life has been so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely, and he missed out on all this lovely gold. How I love gold!"

    Robin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune-tellers when the coach passed by. "Care to have your fortune told, Your Majesty?" "Fortune-tellers! How droll! Stop the coach!" While Robin Hood told Prince John's fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the prince's gold. Prince John never even knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John had escaped.

    Second clip

    Robin Hood and Little John, walking through the forest,
    Laughing back and forth at what the other one has to say.
    Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.
    Never ever thinking there was danger in the water,
    They were drinking, they just guzzled it down.
    Never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse,
    Was a-watching them and gathering around.
    Robin Hood and Little John, running through the forest,
    Jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away.
    Contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.

    Little John: You know something, Robin? You're taking too many chances.
    Robin Hood: Chances? You must be joking! That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
    Little John: Yeah? Take a look at your hat. That's not a candle on a cake.
    Robin Hood: Hello! This one almost had my name on it, didn't it? They're getting better, you know. You've got to admit it! They are getting better.
    Little John: Yeah, the next time that sheriff will probably have a rope around our necks! Pretty hard to laugh hanging there, Rob!  
    Robin Hood: Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground. En garde!
    Little John: Hey, watch it, Rob. That's the only hat I've got.
    Robin Hood: Oh, come along. You worry too much, old boy.
    Little John: You know something, Robin? I was just wondering. Are we good guys or bad guys? You know. I mean, our robbing the rich to feed the poor.
    Robin Hood: Rob? That's a naughty word. We never rob. We just sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
    Little John: Borrow? Boy, are we in debt.

    Narrator: Many, many years ago, in 16th century Spain, in an area known as La Mancha, there lay a quiet little village. And in the village, there was a large estate that belonged to a middle-aged gentleman, named Alonso Quijano.
    Instead of taking care of his estate like most other gentlemen of the time, Alonso Quijano preferred to read books about chivalry, about knights in shining armor. And the more he read, the more he envied the knights of old. They led such exciting lives. He imagined that he could be a brave knight on a fast steed riding through the land, protecting maidens in distress and slaying dragons and monsters. 
    Don Quixote: Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Yes sir? May I help you?
    Don Quixote: Sancho, I will become a brave knight, and you my squire. We will ride through the land and uphold justice for all.
    Narrator: He was very serious. He changed his name to Don Quixote and wore his great-grandfather's armor. He then mounted a common plough horse and named it Rocinante. And along with his faithful squire, he was ready for his first adventure as a knight.
    The next morning as the sun was shining brightly over the farmland of the village, there suddenly appeared a knight in shining armor and his squire riding through the countryside. Everyone stopped their work to have a look at this strange sight. They just couldn't believe their eyes.
    Don Quixote: Sancho, there is much to do. We must push on. The work of a brave knight is never done.
    Narrator: Don Quixote and Sancho had reached the end of their first day without incident. But Don Quixote dreamed of the adventures to come as they rode into the night.
    The people in the village thought that Don Quixote's behavior was very peculiar.
    Don Quixote and Sancho continued their ride through the countryside. And suddenly, What a lovely girl!
    Don Quixote: Beautiful maiden! Let me introduce myself. I am Don Quixote.
    Aldonza:  Hello. I'm Aldonza. Why have you dressed so strangely?
    Don Quixote: Strangely?  Huh. Why, I am the brave knight of La Mancha.
    Aldonza: Oh, so you're the man I've been hearing about. Is there some kind of unrest in the land that has caused you to become a knight?
    Don Quixote: Unrest? Why, there is much injustice. Yes.
    Narrator: Aldonza gave him a rose. She realized that he was quite harmless. Our brave knight is a real gentleman.
    Our heroes were soon on their way. Don Quixote was overjoyed at finding a beautiful maiden to protect. As they said farewell, he decided to rename her Dulcinea. The next morning, Don Quixote and Sancho were sleeping soundly beneath a large tree when suddenly ...
    Don Quixote: Oh? Huh. An enemy army approaching. Come, Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Master, master!
    Narrator: As the dust cleared. Don Quixote and Sancho could see two groups of animals galloping to the center of the field.
    Don Quixote: The enemy attack!
    Narrator: Don Quixote charged. But wait! They're only sheep. Not to Don Quixote. He imagined an enemy army and he went into action.
    Don Quixote: Where are you? Show yourselves. Come out and fight like men. You sniveling cowards. Come on! [unintelligible] evil doers. All of you! Let's go! Come on!
    Narrator: Don Quixote has fallen from his horse. Is he all right?
    Don Quixote: Come on! Keep coming! I'll take you all on, you scoundrels. Don't run. Aha! Take that. Let's go. I'll take you! Come on!

    Mother: I've got to get her some warm clothing. Is Mr Chisolm standing by?
    Father: Listen. Everyone else has abandoned ship. We're the only ones left on board.
    Joanna: Is the ship sinking, Papa?
    Father: No, Joanna.
    Mother: What happens now?
    Father: Well, it's too dark to see anything. We'll have to wait until morning before we assess the situation. But since we appear to be in no immediate danger, I think we should all get as much rest as possible.
    Father: I'll take first watch, son.
    Christina: I hope Bruno and the other animals are all right.
    Mother: They will be, dear.
    Ernst: The following morning, the family struggled up on deck. Disillusioned, afraid. But so far, we had survived. We were fully expecting to be surrounded by miles and miles of ocean. Everyone was surprised by what we actually saw. We could hardly believe our eyes.
    Joanna: What land is that, Papa?
    Father: I have no idea, Joanna. But it's beautiful. Perhaps it's a peninsula of some kind.
    Mother: We should never have left Boston.
    Christina: What if there are cannibals?
    Mother: Oh, really Christina!
    Christina: But I've read about them, Mama.
    Mother: Then you're reading the wrong sort of book, young lady.
    Christina: There weren't any cannibals in Boston.
    Father: Christina, that's quite enough.
    Joanna: How do we get to shore without a boat?
    Ernst: We could use life rings.
    Father: No, I think what we need to do is to put together something that will float, some sort of a raft.
    Mother: Do you know how to build one?
    Father: Well, no, I don't. But I shall have to try.
    Ernst: The first thing that Father and I did was to go down to the master's cabin and survey the chart for our last-known position.
    Ernst: Well I heard Mr Blake saying that we were being blown south.
    Father: Well, whichever way we were blown, there's no land marked here.
    Christina: All right, Bruno. Just calm down.
    Ernst: Christina was more interested in finding Bruno and checking if the other animals were still alive.
    Christina: What do you think, Bruno. Do we save them, or not?
    Bruno: Woof! Woof!
    Christina. I agree. I do need my egg for breakfast.
    Ernst: While Father and I set about trying to build a raft, Mother and Joanna searched for anything that could be of use. Although neither of them had ever undertaken such hard manual work, between them they managed to haul onto the deck all of the trunks and chests.
    Mother: Well, at least we will be clothed. And not want for food for a while.

    Second clip:
    Mother: How do you know so much?
    Emily: My grandmother was a healer. She knew a lot about herbs. When I was a little girl, she used to teach me.
    Christina: Mother, we saw three goats. One was a baby, a kid.
    Joanna: I saw them too.
    Ernst: Come down from the mountains, it would seem.
    Father: I think we may have manufactured a rudder that actually works.
    Mother: Does that mean that we will soon be able to set sail from here?
    Father: I wouldn't be too certain of that yet, my dear.
    Emily: My father will be mounting a search for me.
    Father: I'm sure he will. But it may take some time. After all. No-one knows where we are. In the meantime, we must take heart and continue to help and support one another.
    Joanna: Tell that to Emily. You said she was to help me. I've asked her again and again. But she refuses.
    Father: Emily, is this true?
    Emily: Billy would do work for me.
    Billy: Yes sir, I will.
    Father: No, he will not. Billy has his own work to do. Emily, under these circumstances, it is very important that we all cooperate with one another. And that means that you must do your work along with everyone else.
    Emily: I am not a servant.
    Father: No, you're not. But if you don't work, you don't eat. You understand that?
    Emily: Well, I'm not hungry.
    Ernst: Little did we realize at the time, that Emily's selfishness and even the volcano would pale in comparison with the enormous danger that lay ahead.

    Ben: Volcano's belching again.
    Parsons: Pay no attention to the volcano. Study the raft.

    Waldman: "How do you do? Mr. Carl Laemmle feels that it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning. We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein. a man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image, without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation, life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So, if any of you feel you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain. now is your chance to, .. er ..  Well, we have warned you!" 

    Second clip:
    Frankenstein: Dr Waldman, I learned a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray, the ultra-violet ray, that you said was the highest color in the spectrum. You were wrong. Here in this machine, I have gone beyond that. I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
    Waldman: Oh. And your proof?
    Frankenstein: Tonight, you shall have your proof. But first, I experimented only with dead animals, and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks. But now I am going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.
    Waldman: And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
    Frankenstein: That body is not dead. It has never lived. I created it. I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere. Go and see for yourself.

    Quite a good scene, isn't it? One man crazy. Three very sane spectators.

    Look! It's moving. It's alive. It's alive....It's alive, it's moving, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive! Oh - in the name of God. Now I know what it feels like to be God.

    Third clip:
    Father: You stay here, Maria. I'll just take a look at my traps. Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
    Child: You won't be long, Daddy?
    Father: Oh, no. If Franz comes by, tell him I'll be back soon.
    Child: Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
    Father: I'm too busy, darling. You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
    Child: Bye, daddy.
    Father: Bye. Be a good girl now.
    Child: Come on, kitty.
    Child: Who are you? I'm Maria.

    Child: Will you play with me?
    Child: Would you like one of my flowers?
    Child: You have those, and I'll have these.

    Frederick: Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts myself, but this is excellent.
    Igor: Who are you talking to?
    Frederick: To you. You just made a yummy sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
    Igor: I didn't make a yummy sound, I just asked you what it is.
    Frederick: But you did. I just heard it.
    Igor: It wasn't me.

    Doctor: Yes, you're right, Mrs Corney
    Bumble: I wonder where she [...]. Her shoes were worn to pieces.
    Doctor: No wedding ring. I see. The old story. Another mouth for the orphanage?
    Bumble: Until he's old enough for the orphanage, I'll be father and mother to him.

    4:20 Bumble: Now, you mind your manners.
    Oliver: Ow!
    Bumble: Good day, gentlemen.
    Limbkins: What's your name, boy?
    Oliver: Oliver Twist.
    Limbkins: What? Who gave you that name?
    Bumble: I did, sir. You see, I name my orphans according to a little invention of my own. For the given names, according to the month. The surnames, according to the alphabetical order in which they arrive. If it's in July, it's 'James' or 'John,' and so on. Now this lad, here, came in October, 'O' for 'October,' 'O' for 'Oliver.' He was the twentieth that came that year. The twentieth letter of the alphabet is 'T.' 'T' for 'Twist.' 'O' for 'Oliver,' "T' for 'Twist.' I called him 'Oliver Twist.' Simple, ain't it? Of course, I've lots of trouble with the 'X's and the 'Z's.
    Limbkins: We understand, Mr Bumble.
    Limbkins: You know you're an orphan, don't you?
    Oliver:
    Councillor: The boy's a fool. I knew he was.
    Limbkins: You know that you have no father and mother, don't you? That you were brought up by the parish?
    Councillor: What are you crying for?
    Councillor: I hope you say your prayers every night. And pray for the people who take care of you, and feed you.
    Limbkins: You come here to be educated and to learn a useful trade.
    Councillor: And so, tomorrow morning, you begin by scrubbing the floor of the workhouse dining room. And after that ...

    7:50 Master: Say grace. For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Boys: For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Cook: Blimey, he wants more.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Master: Mr Bumble, Mr Bumble!
    Master: Mr Limbkins. Beg pardon, sir. But Oliver Twist has asked for more.
    Limbkins: What? Am I to understand that after he had eaten a generous supper the law allows, he asked for more? Bumble, lock him up.
    Bumble: Yes, sir. You come with me. The boy's an incorrigible, sir. Can't you arrange to apprentice him to someone?
    Limbkins: I will.
    Councillor: That boy will be hanged. I know he will be hanged.

    13:15 Fagin: Well, ahem, I hope you've been working this morning, my dears.
    Mmh. Aren't they lined beautifully. What an ingenious workman! Oliver, wouldn't you like to make pocket handkerchiefs as easily as Charley Bates?
    Oliver: Very much, sir, if you'll teach me.
    Charley: Hee-hee-hee.
    Fagin: My dears, shall we have a little game?
    Dodger: Right-o.

    Oliver: If you please, sir.

    Child: Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
    Father: I'm too busy, darling. You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
    Child: Bye, daddy.
    Father: Bye. Be a good girl now.
    Child: Come on, kitty.
    Child: Who are you? I'm Maria.

    Child: Will you play with me?
    Child: Would you like one of my flowers?
    Child: You have those, and I'll have these.
    Child: I can make a boat. See how mine floats?

    Child: Monster: Oh, oh.
    Child: Oh, you're hurting me. No!
 
    Oliver Twist

    4:20 Bumble: Now, you mind your manners.
    Oliver: Ow!
    Bumble: Good day, gentlemen.
    Limbkins: What's your name, boy?
    Oliver: Oliver Twist.
    Limbkins: What? Who gave you that name?
    Bumble: I did, sir. You see, I name my orphans according to a little invention of my own. For the given names, according to the month. The surnames, according to the alphabetical order in which they arrive. If it's in July, it's 'James' or 'John,' and so on. Now this lad, here, came in October, 'O' for 'October,' 'O' for 'Oliver.' He was the twentieth that came that year. The twentieth letter of the alphabet is 'T.' 'T' for 'Twist.' 'O' for 'Oliver,' "T' for 'Twist.' I called him 'Oliver Twist.' Simple, ain't it? Of course, I've lots of trouble with the 'X's and the 'Z's.
    Limbkins: We understand, Mr Bumble.
    Limbkins: You know you're an orphan, don't you?
    Oliver:
    Councillor: The boy's a fool. I knew he was.
    Limbkins: You know that you have no father and mother, don't you? That you were brought up by the parish?
    Councillor: What are you crying for?
    Councillor: I hope you say your prayers every night. And pray for the people who take care of you, and feed you.
    Limbkins: You come here to be educated and to learn a useful trade.
    Councillor: And so, tomorrow morning, you begin by scrubbing the floor of the workhouse dining room. And after that ...

    7:50 Master: Say grace. For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Boys: For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Cook: Blimey, he wants more.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Master: Mr Bumble, Mr Bumble!
    Master: Mr Limbkins. Beg pardon, sir. But Oliver Twist has asked for more.
    Limbkins: What? Am I to understand that after he had eaten a generous supper the law allows, he asked for more? Bumble, lock him up.

    13:15 Fagin: Well, ahem, I hope you've been working this morning, my dears.
    Mmh. Aren't they lined beautifully. What an ingenious workman! Oliver, wouldn't you like to make pocket handkerchiefs as easily as Charley Bates?
    Oliver: Very much, sir, if you'll teach me.
    Charley: Hee-hee-hee.
    Fagin: My dears, shall we have a little game?
    Dodger: Right-o.
    Fagin: Just to amuse Oliver.
    Dodger: Right-o.
    Fagin: Hey, Oliver?

    First clip:
    Narrator: There are things in this world worth fighting and dying for. We're warriors. It's who we are. It's what we do.
    Mickey: The three musketeers. I came to Paris to be one of you.
    Narrator: d'Artagnan, you want to be a musketeer? This is your chance. We live in a kingdom controlled by fear. The cardinal rules the land. Buckingham rules the skies. [..] And she is the deadliest assassin the world has ever seen. Together they will unleash war on the entire continent.
    Mickey: We're the musketeers. It's up to us to put an end to the cardinal's plot.
    Goofy: I can do with some exercise.
    Mickey, Goofy: Donald: All for one. And one for all.

    Second clip:
    Comte de Rochefort: [...] someone riding a buttercup. Unless it is a cheese, with legs. 
    d'Artagnan: Tell me what you laugh at, sir, and we will laugh together, if you speak to me.
    Comte de Rochefort: If you were a gentleman, I would speak to you. I was speaking at you, sir.
    d'Artagnan: But I am speaking to you, sir. Turn if you are a man, and see you laugh now.
    Comte de Rochefort: He's a Gascon.
    Follower: Shall I cut his throat?
    Comte de Rochefort: No, put him on his ridiculous horse and let him go.

    Comte de Rochefort: No time to talk, my lady. The cardinal commands you to England. You are to let him know the moment the Duke of Buckingham leaves London.
    Milady de Winter: And then?
    Comte de Rochefort: Await his further orders.
    Milady de Winter: And you? When shall I see you again?
    d'Artagnan: You? You assassin. I shall chastise you, sir. Forgive me, madam, but I must kill your friend.
    Milady de Winter: Are you not terrified?
    Comte de Rochefort: Ha! Away, bumpkin! You will hear from me.
    Kitty: He's very handsome.
    [...]
    Comte de Rochefort: Lord, pay the bill.

    Third clip:
    Musketeers: All for one. And one for all.
    Narrator: There are three: Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

    1:35 Athos: Only a fool would try to arrest us twice in one day.
    Jussac: You're under arrest.
    Aramis, Pathos: A fool.
    Jussac: Are you coming peacefully, or do you intend to resist?
    Porthos: Oh, don't be so stupid. Of course we intend to resist. Just give us a moment, all right?
    Porthos: Five of them, three of us. Hardly seems fair.
    Aramis: Perhaps we should give them a chance to surrender.
    d'Artagnan: Excuse me, but there's four of us.
    Athos: It's not your fight. You're not a musketeer.
    d'Artagnan: I may not wear the tunic. But I believe I have the heart of a musketeer.
    Porthos: Warrior.
    Aramis: Poet.
    Athos: You got a name, boy?
    d'Artagnan: d'Artagnan.
    Athos: Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
    Porthos: Hello.
    d'Artagnan: Nice to meet you again.
    Aramis; A pleasure.
    Porthos: Everyone acquainted?
    Porthos: And now we are prepared to resist.

    Fourth clip:
    d'Artagnan: It's the coach. Hurry, Athos. 
    Athos: It is done, d'Artagnan. One tug of the string, and the pistol will explode the flask filled with powder. And, voila, no more bridge.
    d'Artagnan: Good. To your posts. Now, Athos.
    Aramis: Keep your place, coachman, and you will retain your health.
    d'Artagnan: The door is locked from within.
    Aramis: I have a simple solution.
    d'Artagnan: A foolish attempt, messenger. Now I will relieve you of the letter you carry.
    Messenger: You will regret this, musketeer.
    d'Artagnan: We shall see, monsieur.

    Queen Anne: You have done well, my musketeers. This letter from the Duke Duval carries a plan of treachery against the king.
    Constance: Then you will surely expose him for his evil plot, Your Highness.
    Queen Anne: As soon as the king returns from the North, Constance.
    Porthos: Until then, Your Majesty, we will guard you and the letter with our lives.

    Clip 1:
    Helmsman: Captain, there's something in the water off the port bow.
    Captain: I'd say it's a whale, if it weren't so enormous. It's heading toward us. Full right rudder.
    Narrator: Rankin Bass present Festival of Family Classics. [...] From the exciting world of Jules Verne, the thrilling underwater adventure, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. [...]

    Captain: On July 20, 1866, less than eight months ago, the steamer, Governor Higgins sighted what they thought was an unknown reef five miles east of the Australian coast. But as the captain was plotting its position, the reef suddenly spouted two enormous columns of water, and moved away. And then just last month, the Scotia was rammed by something like an enormous whale, leaving a hole in her steel hull in the shape of a perfect triangle. Not only can this thing move at incredible speeds, but we estimate it is at least 355 feet long or at least as large as this ship. Whatever this thing is, monster or machine, we have been commissioned to find it and destroy it, I will pay 2,000 dollars to the man who first sights it.
    Pierre Aronnax: Conrad, are you sure you still want to go?
    Conrad: What? And miss out on history's greatest fishing trip?
    Pierre Aronnax: People don't always come back from expeditions like these.
    Conrad: But those are always other people. I'll take my chances.
    Captain: Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: Yes, Commander?
    Captain: Welcome aboard, Mr Aronnax. It's a pleasure having you and your young assistant with us.
    Aronnax: Thank you, [...]
    Captain: I'd like you both to meet Ned Land, the finest harpooner in all of North America.
    Aronnax: I've heard of you, sir. Your skill is known even in Europe.
    Captain: Well, now all we have to do is find this, er, overgrown whale, or whatever it is.
    Land: Aye, I can't believe it's a whale. I've never seen one that could crack the steel plates of a steamship.
    Captain: What else could it be? No other fish or ship known to man that big or that powerful.
    Aronnax: I'm not so sure, Captain. It could be a giant narwhal.
    Land: What's that?
    Aronnax: It's a rare kind of whale with a long ivory tusk. Kind of a giant unicorn fish.
    Captain: Well, whatever it is, I hope that you'll be able to identify it, Mr Aronnax. And, you, Ned, be able to kill it, before it destroys us.

    Conrad: Look, he caught it.
    Captain: She, Conrad. That's a female porpoise.
    Conrad: She reminds me of my little sister, Fifi. Here, Fifi. 
    Aronnax: Two months. We've sighted nothing but porpoises. It's all very discouraging, Conrad.
    Conrad: We'll be the laughing stock of the world when we get back.
    Aronnax: I know, Conrad. I know.
    Seaman: Ahoy. There she blows.
    Conrad: Look, there.
    Aronnax: That must be it.
    Captain: Man the lifeboat.
    Land: Come on in, monster. Find the end of my harpoon.
    Conrad: It's still coming. Watch out.
    Captain: There goes Ned.
    Seaman: Man overboard.
    [...]
    Conrad: Look out. It's turning. It's going to ram us.

    Aronnax: I don't know how much longer I can hold out, Conrad.
    Conrad: I think I see something, Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: What?
    Conrad: I'm not sure, but I think .. Yes. It's Fifi. Grab hold.
    Aronnax: I wonder where she's taking us.
    Conrad: Maybe to land.
    Aronnax: It must be at least a thousand miles from land, Conrad.
    Conrad: What was that?
    Land: Ahoy.
    Conrad: Ned.
    Land: Welcome aboard, Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: What is this?
    Land: Your giant narwhal.
    Aronnax: What? It's man-made.
    Land: Take your hands off me.

    Conrad: Look. Dry clothes.
    Aronnax: Sealskin. And some strange cloth I've never seen before. It almost looks like it was woven from sea grass.
    Land: What do you think they'll do to us?
    Conrad: Feed us.
    Aronnax: Hey, stop.

    Clip 2:
    Captain Nemo: We are taking the Nautilus down for the last time.
    Officer: We understand, sir. And we're with you.
    Land: Wait a minute. I don't understand. What's that got to do with us?
    Nemo: I'm dying, and the Nautilus is dying with me. Professor?
    Aronnax: Yes.
    Nemo: In a matter of minutes, an explosion, such as the world has never known, will destroy my island and all its works forever. That is why I have brought the Nautilus here, to its last, deep resting place. Here at least we will die in peace. Let every man go to his quarters and remain there.
    Land: Why do you take us down with you?
    Nemo: Lock them in their quarters.
    Officer: Aye, sir. Take them out.
    Land: I don't want to die. Don't let him do it. I want no part of this!
    Aronnax: Captain, you cannot do this. There is more at stake here than just our lives. Yours was a dream of the future come true. I beg you to reconsider.
    Nemo: A power greater than mine makes that impossible. But there is hope for the future. When the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass, in God's good time.
    Aronnax: I'm sorry, Ned.
    Land: Don't give up, mates! We're no part of any suicide pact!
    Officer: Put him in his cabin.

    1955 verion:
    1:40 Poole: Dr Jekyll, Dr Jekyll. Are you all right?
    Jekyll: Go away.
    Poole: Please sir, let me in.
    Jekyll: Go away.

    Utterson: Come now, Poole. Either Dr Jekyll has gone or he has not. Now which is it?
    Poole. Well, I don't know, Mr Utterson. I can't say, sir. Oh, it's been a most terrible time, sir. Over two weeks now, he's been locked in his laboratory, won't come out. We put his meals there by the door. Then after we go away, he takes them inside, if he's inside.
    Utterson: Who else could be?
    Poole: Look, sir. Here are two of the prescriptions he left with me only this afternoon. Now, you know Dr Jekyll's handwriting. Is that his hand?
    Utterson: Very odd. Very odd, indeed.
    Poole: Yes, but is it Dr Jekyll's writing?
    Utterson: Well, yes and no. I should say that under great stress he might write like this.
    Poole: Begging your pardon, sir. I think it's the other.
    Utterson: The other? What other?
    Poole: Oh, you know, sir. You'll remember him. His friend. Hyde, his name was.
    Utterson: But Hyde disappeared a year ago. He wouldn't dare to return with the police after him.
    Poole: I believe he's back, sir. And I believe he's done something to Dr Jekyll.
    Utterson: We should pay a visit to Mr Hyde. If it is he.
    Poole: Yes, sir. I should bring a pistol, sir, if I went into that room.
    Utterson: Yes. You may be right. After all, he is a murderer. I could never understand why Jekyll took up with him. 
    Poole: I think it was what you might call an experiment, sir. Dr Jekyll knew some very strange people.
    Utterson: Even murderers?

    Utterson: I say, [..], are you inside?
    Jekyll: Go away.
    Utterson: Utterson, it's your friend, Utterson. Now let me in, like a good chap.
    Jekyll: Leave this house.
    Utterson: That's not Dr Jekyll's voice.
    Poole: I was right, sir. There's someone else in there.
    Utterson: Do you think it's Hyde?
    Poole: Sounds like him.
    Utterson: If it's you, Hyde, let us in or we'll force the door. All right, Poole.
    Utterson: All right, now. Where are you?
    Poole: He's dead, sir.
    Utterson: Yes. It was Hyde, wasn't it?
    Poole: Yes, sir. It was Mr Hyde. Do you think he's killed Dr Jekyll?
    Utterson: I don't know. I want you to go to the police. Tell them the murderer, Hyde has been killed. I shall wait for the police here.
    Poole: Yes, sir.
    Utterson: George Utterson, Esquire. To be opened in the event of my death or disappearance. Henry Jekyll.
    Jekyll: When you read this, dear friend, I shall be dead. And only this journal will remain to clarify a mystery, to exert a warning. You will recall perhaps a conversation we had two years ago when you came to see me and you found Dr Lanyon and me arguing.
    Lanyon: My dear Jekyll, you astonish me. A grown man like you talking like a romantic boy.
    Jekyll: Lanyon, We are scientists. In theory, nothing is impossible. 
    Lanyon: That may be true, but some things are clearly improbable. Your idea's too fantastic.
    Poole: Mr Utterson to see you, sir.
    Jekyll: We're having a row.
    Utterson: Oh. So, shall we go to law?
    Jekyll: No, we might need your fine legal mind to arbitrate.
    Lanyon: Jekyll here has decided to go beyond science, leaving me far behind. I am only a doctor. A simple, ordinary doctor.
    Jekyll: Like me.
    Utterson: No. You're not simple, and you're not ordinary.
    Lanyon: Do you know what this outrageous fellow proposes to do?
    Utterson: Raise the dead?
    Lanyon: Better than that. He wants to find the soul. He wants to play with it, to experiment upon.
    Jekyll: [..] I merely suggested one way of discovering the nature of the soul would be to dissect it the way you would any other organism. 
    Utterson: I was under the impression the soul was not tangible.
    Jekyll: Neither is the air, but we know it exists. We can alter it. See? Fire. We're burning oxygen. This match is creating carbon dioxide. We've altered a substance no-one can see. Why not the soul?
    Utterson: Why not indeed. But where do you find it?
    Jekyll: In the mind, I should think. Which parts of the mind which regulate behavior. If I were to take up this poker, dear Lanyon, and kill you.
    Lanyon: Well, I wouldn't put it past you. You're as mad as a hatter.
    Jekyll: I should suffer terrible pangs of conscience afterwards. That would be my sole punishment.
    Utterson: There is a small matter of the law, you know.
    Jekyll: All right. But suppose the mind could be so changed that I could strike Lanyon to the ground and feel nothing. Only pleasure in a violent act. And there is something in all of us, that caged beast, which delights in horror and destruction.
    Utterson: The whole idea is far too fanciful 
    Lanyon: And slightly unwholesome.
    Jekyll: Utterson, I helieve I'm on the track of something quite fantastic.
    Utterson: The soul?
    Jekyll: The soul. Good and evil. I believe it's possible artificially to produce either a monster or an angel in the same man.
    Lanyon: Rubbish. Where's my tea. I came here for tea, not a Black Mass.
    Jekyll: You'll have your tea, my old intolerant friend.
    Lanyon: Monster or an angel.
    Utterson: Do you really believe that human beings are both?
    Jekyll: I do. Oh, none of us is either very good or very bad. We're just a mixture. A blend you might say, like, like Lanyon's beloved China tea. Bring it in, please.
    Utterson: But, aren't you afraid to upset the balance of a soul.
    Jekyll: Well, why not. I'd only bring out what was already there. What was good.
    Utterson: The angel.
    Jekyll: Exactly.
    Utterson: But suppose you released the monster. Suppose, my dear Jekyll, that you uncaged the monster.
    Jekyll: That's a risk one would have to take in the interests of science.
    Lanyon: [..]
    Jekyll: But the tea? 
    Lanyon: A proper blend. No doubt of it.
    Jekyll: Milk and sugar?
    Lanyon: Oh, I saw a client of yours today.
    Jekyll: I was aware I had spoken too soon of my great interests. But I was curious to see how Lanyon and how you, Utterson would respond to the idea of my experiments. I determined to say nothing more of my work until I was further along. As you remember, that winter we did not meet often. I was daily, nightly, engaged in my work, my deliberate and hazardous journey into the soul of self. Thank you, Poole.
    Poole: Yes, sir. Uh, sir.
    Jekyll: Yes, Poole.
    Poole: Sir, don't you think .. Well, I mean it's not my place, but ..
    Jekyll: I work too hard? I need a rest?
    Poole: Exactly, sir. You know it's not natural, all these hours you spend here. Only today, Dr Lanyon called. And much put out he was too when you wouldn't receive him.
    Jekyll: Poole, I'll make you a promise. Either I conclude my experiments this week, or I give them up altogether.
    Poole: Oh, thank you, sir. It would be a great relief to us all. [..]
    Jekyll: I had no idea, when I made Poole my promise that success was at hand. After months of tedious experiment, I had found almost by accident, the proper substances which, combined, had the power to split the soul in two. The basic preparation involved a solution in which certain salts were combined and balanced. On this occasion, I added to them one of the new powders brought to me by Poole. The change in the solution's color was not anticipated. For a moment I hesitated. I had been my own guinea pig from the beginning. I had tried on myself all the formulae which had failed. Now if I was to succeed, did I dare take the consequences of my extraordinary act. I paused uncertain for a single heart beat. Then I drank the liquid. For a moment, I thought I was dying, sinking into oblivion. 


    1941 version:
    Poole: Dr Jekyll, that frightful maniac broke into the house. Did he attack you, sir?
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Policeman: Which way did he go, sir? Out there?
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Poole: I didn't even know you were at home, sir. Are you badly hurt?
    Jekyll: No, I'll be all right.
    Policeman: This door here is locked. We'd better go out that way.
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Lanyon: Wait. There. Heaven help him.
    Higgins: But I know this gentleman. He's Dr Jekyll.
    Lanyon: I know. Nevertheless, there's your man.
    Poole: I'm sorry, sir, but I know Dr Jekyll. I've known him for years.
    Higgins: This is your master, isn't it.
    Poole: Of course, sir. No doubt about it, sir.
    Higgins: Then we must have lost him. Come, men.
    Lanyon: No, no, no. Wait. Tell them, Jekyll. Tell them. It's no use, Jekyll. You know it's no use. Tell them what happened. I beg of you, Jekyll. Tell them who you are. Tell them what you've done.
    Jekyll: I've done nothing. I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll. I've done nothing. I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll, I tell you. I've done nothing. You're looking for a man named Hyde. Hyde. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll. I'm Dr Jekyll, I tell you. I tell you, I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll.
    Higgins: It's no use, Jekyll. You'd better come quietly.

    Land: Don't give up, mates! We're no part of any suicide pact!
    Officer: Put him in his cabin.

    Clip 3:
    Utterson: George Utterson, Esquire. To be opened in the event of my death or disappearance. Henry Jekyll.
    Jekyll: When you read this, dear friend, I shall be dead. And only this journal will remain to clarify a mystery, to exert a warning. You will recall perhaps a conversation we had two years ago when you came to see me and you found Dr Lanyon and me arguing.
    Lanyon: My dear Jekyll, you astonish me. A grown man like you talking like a romantic boy.
    Jekyll: Lanyon, We are scientists. In theory, nothing is impossible. 
    Lanyon: That may be true, but some things are clearly improbable. Your idea's too fantastic.
    Poole: Mr Utterson to see you, sir.
    Jekyll: We're having a row.
    Utterson: Oh. So, shall we go to law?
    Jekyll: No, we might need your fine legal mind to arbitrate.
    Lanyon: Jekyll here has decided to go beyond science, leaving me far behind. I am only a doctor. A simple, ordinary doctor.
    Jekyll: Like me.
    Utterson: No. You're not simple, and you're not ordinary.
    Lanyon: Do you know what this outrageous fellow proposes to do?
    Utterson: Raise the dead?
    Lanyon: Better than that. He wants to find the soul. He wants to play with it, to experiment upon.
    Jekyll: [..] I merely suggested one way of discovering the nature of the soul would be to dissect it the way you would any other organism. 
    Utterson: I was under the impression the soul was not tangible.
    Jekyll: Neither is the air, but we know it exists. We can alter it. See? Fire. We're burning oxygen. This match is creating carbon dioxide. We've altered a substance no-one can see. Why not the soul?
    Utterson: Why not indeed. But where do you find it?
    Jekyll: In the mind, I should think. Which parts of the mind which regulate behavior. If I were to take up this poker, dear Lanyon, and kill you.
    Lanyon: Well, I wouldn't put it past you. You're as mad as a hatter.
    Jekyll: I should suffer terrible pangs of conscience afterwards. That would be my sole punishment.
    Utterson: There is a small matter of the law, you know.
    Jekyll: All right. But suppose the mind could be so changed that I could strike Lanyon to the ground and feel nothing. Only pleasure in a violent act. And there is something in all of us, that caged beast, which delights in horror and destruction.
    Utterson: The whole idea is far too fanciful 
    Lanyon: And slightly unwholesome.
    Jekyll: Utterson, I helieve I'm on the track of something quite fantastic.
    Utterson: The soul?
    Jekyll: The soul. Good and evil. I believe it's possible artificially to produce either a monster or an angel in the same man.
    Lanyon: Rubbish. Where's my tea. I came here for tea, not a Black Mass.
    Jekyll: You'll have your tea, my old intolerant friend.
    Lanyon: Monster or an angel.
    Utterson: Do you really believe that human beings are both?
    Jekyll: I do. Oh, none of us is either very good or very bad. We're just a mixture. A blend you might say, like, like Lanyon's beloved China tea. Bring it in, please.
    Utterson: But, aren't you afraid to upset the balance of a soul.
    Jekyll: Well, why not. I'd only bring out what was already there. What was good.
    Utterson: The angel.
    Jekyll: Exactly.
    Utterson: But suppose you released the monster. Suppose, my dear Jekyll, that you uncaged the monster.
    Jekyll: That's a risk one would have to take in the interests of science.
    Lanyon: [..]
    Jekyll: But the tea? 
    Lanyon: A proper blend. No doubt of it.
    Jekyll: Milk and sugar?
    Lanyon: Oh, I saw a client of yours today.
    Jekyll: I was aware I had spoken too soon of my great interests. But I was curious to see how Lanyon and how you, Utterson would respond to the idea of my experiments. I determined to say nothing more of my work until I was further along. As you remember, that winter we did not meet often. I was daily, nightly, engaged in my work, my deliberate and hazardous journey into the soul of self. Thank you, Poole.
    Poole: Yes, sir. Uh, sir.
    Jekyll: Yes, Poole.
    Poole: Sir, don't you think .. Well, I mean it's not my place, but ..
    Jekyll: I work too hard? I need a rest?
    Poole: Exactly, sir. You know it's not natural, all these hours you spend here. Only today, Dr Lanyon called. And much put out he was too when you wouldn't receive him.
    Jekyll: Poole, I'll make you a promise. Either I conclude my experiments this week, or I give them up altogether.
    Poole: Oh, thank you, sir. It would be a great relief to us all. [..]
    Jekyll: I had no idea, when I made Poole my promise that success was at hand. After months of tedious experiment, I had found almost by accident, the proper substances which, combined, had the power to split the soul in two. The basic preparation involved a solution in which certain salts were combined and balanced. On this occasion, I added to them one of the new powders brought to me by Poole. The change in the solution's color was not anticipated. For a moment I hesitated. I had been my own guinea pig from the beginning. I had tried on myself all the formulae which had failed. Now if I was to succeed, did I dare take the consequences of my extraordinary act. I paused uncertain for a single heart beat. Then I drank the liquid. For a moment, I thought I was dying, sinking into oblivion.

    Clip 1:
    Narrator: Years ago, a boy was lost in the jungle. Legend has it, he survived, raised by animals. 

    Clip 2:
    2:50 Mother: And we must not spoil the beautiful jungle for some foolish advantage of our own.
    Father: Now, now, my dear. I think that's a little difficult for him to understand. Oh, look. He's fallen asleep. Sound asleep in the middle of the jungle. miles from civilization. He's still too young to be afraid of anything.
    Mother: Our boy is going to be a friend of this jungle. When he grows up, I'm sure he will carry on with our work of protecting nature.
    Father: Now, let's go and collect some soil and water samples, while he's still sleeping.
    Mother: Have a good sleep, my child. ... The air and water seem so fresh and pure out here, don't they.
    Father: Well, I wouldn't be able to answer that until I analyze the samples back at the university. If that pollution has spread as far as this jungle, it could be very serious.

    ...

    4:56 Shere Khan: I smell humans. I hate humans.
    Villager 1: He's after our cattle.
    Villager 2: There he is.
    ...
    Shere Khan: Tabaqui! Tabaqui!
    Tabaqui: Here I am.
    Shere Khan: I smell a human in the jungle. Go and find him.
    Tabaqui: Um, but, but you wouldn't catch a human, would you?  It is against our law. It is against the Law of the Jungle.
    Shere Khan: I make the laws in my hunting ground. Now, go.
    Tabaqui: Yes, Shere Khan. I understand.

    ...

    6:20 Kaa: Well, well. A little man-cub. Stop doing that, you hear?  Where do you come from? Cut that out! You're just a nuisance. Now run along home. Stop screaming with that awful voice of yours. Aha, so you like that, eh? Well just try and behave yourself. You're very lucky that I'm a good python. Or you wouldn't be here right now.
    Baloo: There's no such thing as good pythons and bad pythons. It depends on whether your stomach is empty or full. 
    Kaa: Now, now, Baloo. Who do you think you're speaking to. I know the Law of the Jungle. What would become of me, if I were to start hunting humans. 
    Baloo: So, this is the man-cub. I've never seen one up so close before. [...] Cute little critter, isn't he.
    Kaa: All animals are cute when they're cubs. But he'll be a danger to the jungle when he grows up.
    Baloo: I'm afraid you're right. His parents must be looking for him. We'd better take him back to them, before he gets us into trouble, Kaa.
    Kaa: Yes, that's a good idea. Go ahead.
    Baloo: Kaa, Wait. Where are you going?
    Kaa: He's yours now. You can do what you want.
    Baloo: But I don't know what to do with him.
    Kaa: Go and find Bagheera. He knows a lot about human creatures.
    Baloo: Promise me that you'll bring him right back. And you won't fall asleep on the way, will you?
    Kaa: I'll try not to.
    Baloo: A little boy.
    Mother: My little boy! Where is he? Where is he?
    Father: What's the matter? Isn't he here?
    Mother: I left him sleeping in the tent in his crib.
    Father: He must have wandered off, into the jungle.
    Bagheera: Who's that?
    Kaa: Bagheera, nice to see you.
    Bagheera: What do you want?
    Kaa: We found a man-cub, here in the jungle.
    Bagheera: A man-cub came to a place like this?
    Kaa: That's right. Baloo has him now. But we should get him out of the jungle before he causes trouble. We thought you might know what to do.
    Bagheera: Because I was once looked after by humans?
    Kaa: Yes, but in spite of that, everyone in the jungle feels Bagheera's a friend.
    Bagheera: I don't need any friends.
    Kaa: Now, Bagheera. Shere Khan.
    Bagheera: Yes, I think your man-cub is already causing trouble.
    Kaa: Now, what?
    Bagheera: Find the cub's parents before Shere Khan does and chase them out of the jungle.
    Kaa: What about the cub?
    Bagheera: I have other things to think about.
    Kaa: Why does everything always happen at once?
    Baloo: Those birds mean trouble. Shere Khan's coming. You, boy. Wake up, wake up, I said. We have to move. Oh.

    ...

    16:50 Father Wolf: That's a man cub. What's it doing here? 
    Mother Wolf: Poor thing. He must have lost his way. He isn't frightened at all. Look he's feeding. Just like our own two cubs are.
    Father Wolf: He certainly is a hungry little fellow.
    Mother Wolf: Isn't he, though.
    Father Wolf: Uh, oh. That sounds like Shere Khan. Get the cubs inside the lair, [..]
    Mother Wolf: Yes, dear.
    Shere Khan: I smell a man-cub. I've come to claim my prize.
    Father Wolf: This's not your hunting ground. Get out of here.
    Shere Khan: I tracked him here. I want him.
    Father Wolf: You're not getting him.
    Shere Khan: How dare you disobey! How dare you! Give me that man-cub.
    Father Wolf: No, I won't. From now on, he's part of my family.
    Shere Khan: Your family?
    Father Wolf: Go away now. Leave us alone, Shere Khan.
    Shere Khan: I'm warning you, Alexander. I'll make you pay for this.

    Clip 1:
    00:19 Vox 114: Welcome. How may I help you? Over here. Area of Inquiry?
    Hartdegen: Tell me about the Time Machine.
    Vox 114: The Time Machine was written by H. G. Wells in 1894. It was later adapted to a motion [...]
    Hartdegen: Thank you. That's quite enough.
    Vox 114: Will there be anything else?
    Hartdegen: Er, no, no. I think I'll have better luck in a few hundred years.

    Older man: Time travel.
    Hartdegen: It's possible, sir.
    Older man: Not in this world.

    Mara: Where do you come from?
    Hartdegen: I'm from the past.
    Philby: I wonder if we'll ever go too far.
    Hartdegen: What.
    Philby: To this with all of this.
    Hartdegen: No such thing.

    Mara: Why have you traveled through time?
    Hartdegen: To have a question answered. I [...] to change the past.
    Mara: Why would you want to? You lost someone. Someone you loved very much.

    Mara: You should go back to your own time.
    Hartdegen: Why?
    Mara: There are things better left not said.
    Hartdegen: Tell me what's happening here.
    Vox 114: [...] the truth will haunt your dreams for all time.
    Hartdegen: Well, I think I'm used to that.

    Hartdegen: It wasn't supposed to happen. They're human beings.
    Uber-Morlock: I can look inside your memories, your dreams, your nightmares.

    Hartdegen: You have to fight. You have to resist. 
    Uber-Morlock: Nothing will change the future.
    Hartdegen: You're wrong. I will change it.

    Clip 2:
    Perry: Well that doesn't make sense. Why?
    Weena: We've never understood that either.
    Perry: And your elders? What happened to them?
    Weena: It will be dark soon. We must return to the others.
    Perry: You didn't answer my question.
    Weena: You'll have your answer soon enough.
    Perry: What's going on?
    Weena: It is a night of the new moon. It'll be very dark.
    Perry: So?
    Weena: The Morlocks'll come.
    Ariel: Weena. Where were you? I was worried.
    Weena: We were just walking.
    Ariel: Have you told him?
    Weena: Not yet.
    Ariel: Why?
    Perry: Will somebody tell me what's going on?
    Ariel: I believe my sister was trying to spare you. But you must be told.
    Perry: Told what?
    Ariel: Our parents and all the elders. They were once among us. One by one, they've been taken by the Morlocks.
    Perry: They've been taken? Why?
    Ariel: We do not know.
    Perry: And they do this at night?
    Ariel: Only when it is very dark. You are the oldest here. They will surely try and take you.

    Perry: You're shaking.
    Weena: It's not important. Tell me about your world.
    Perry: That's a big order.
    Weena: Are your people friendly? Do they get along with each other?
    Perry: Sometimes.
    Weena: Is there fear in your world?
    Perry: Yes. There's also love and compassion.
    Weena: Then your world has hope for its future.
    Perry: I'm having a lot of doubts about that.
    Weena: But if you have love and hope, then there must be a future. We Eloi, we have no hope for our future.
    Perry: Well, I'm afraid our future is your past.
    Weena: I don't understand.
    Perry: I'm not from another world, Weena. I'm from this world, from your past. And it's that past that's brought the world to this.
    Weena: To a place without hope for its future?
    Perry: That's why I've got to return. To make people realize that our world is helping plant the seeds of destruction.
    Weena: Will they believe you?
    Perry: I don't know, but somehow I have to try.
    Ariel: Sh.
    Weena: They're coming.
    
    5:20 Perry: No. Weena, the matches. Find the matches. Hurry, Weena.
    Weena: The Morlocks have taken Ariel. And three others.
    Perry: You know the Morlocks have to have taken your people underground.
    Weena: But, why?
    Perry: I don't know yet. But we have learned that their eyes can't stand the light. And that their weapons only paralyze for a short period of time. Apparently, they want us alive.

    Perry: Haven't you seen fire before? None of you? You can't touch the flame. It can hurt you?
    Weena: Is that what it did to the Morlocks?
    Perry: Well, in a different way. The light blinded them.
    Weena: But it did not hurt our eyes.
    Perry: Well, over the centuries the Morlocks have adapted to the darkness underground. Their eyes have become very sensitive. When I first arrived, I saw a tunnel. Where does it lead?
    Weena: Underground, to the Morlocks. What are you doing?
    Perry: I'm going after your brother and my time machine.
    Weena: You can not do that. They'll take you too.
    Perry: This torch will blind them. Keep them from getting near me.
    Weena: I'm going with you.
    Perry: No. You'd only increase the risk. How many tunnels do the Morlocks have?
    Weena: Two. The closest is beyond the ruins.
    Perry: Is there any other way below?
    Weena: Just the bronze doors. Neil, be careful.
    Perry: Stay together near the fire. I'll do my best to get your friends out. If I find my machine, I won't be back. It has to be that way. I'm sorry.
    Weena: Thank you, Neil.
    
    9:55 Perry: I saw something on the tunnel floor.

    10:00 Station master: Are you waiting for someone, Miss?
    Anne: I am, thank you.
    Station master: Would you prefer to sit in the ladies' waiting room?
    Anne: No, I prefer to sit here. There's so much more scope for the imagination.  Thank you just the same.
    Station master: As you like, Miss.

    Rachel: Thomas! Isn't that Matthew Cuthbert driving that buggy?
    Thomas Lynde: Appears to be.
    Rachel: Well, he never goes to town this time of year, and he never wears a suit except in church.
    Thomas Lynde: Maybe he's going courting.
    Rachel: Don't be so utterly ridiculous, Thomas. He's not going fast enough for a doctor. Oh, my afternoon is spoiled! I won't have a moment's peace until I know what that man is up to. Wearing his suit. Marilla is simply going to have to explain all this.

    Rachel: You, who. Marilla.
    Marilla: Ah, Rachel, good morning. And how are all the Lyndes?
    Rachel: Oh, we're alright as rain, Marilla, but I was kind of worried about you when I saw your brother drive by just now.
    Marilla: Oh, I'm fine. Just fine. Appreciate the concern.
    Rachel: But he was in his suit and smoking his pipe.
    Marilla: Well, I don't mind so long as he smokes his pipe in the great outdoors and not in my kitchen.
    Rachel: He was in his suit.
    Marilla: Yes, Rachel.
    Rachel: Well, Matthew never goes to town this time of year.
    Marilla: Matthew wasn't going to town.
    Rachel: Oh, don't keep me in such suspense.
    Marilla: He was going to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an orphanage in Nova Scotia, and he's coming in on the afternoon train.
    Rachel: A boy! You can't be serious. Well, you don't know anything about raising children. Whatever put such an idea into your head?
    Marilla: Well, Matthew's getting along in years. He's not as spry as he once was and his heart bothers him greatly.

    [...]

    14:15 Station master: Oh, how do, Matthew?
    Matthew: Hello, Angus. Is the afternoon train due soon?
    Station master: Well, been and gone a half an hour ago. There was a passenger dropped off for you. She's waiting for you on the platform.
    Matthew: She?
    Station master: Not to worry, Matthew. I don't think she bites.
    Matthew: Well, it's a boy I've come for.
    Station master: Oh, she won't have any trouble explaining. She has a tongue of her own.

    Clip 2:
    00:00 Anne: I suppose you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert. My name is Anne Shirley. Anne is spelled with an "e." I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me today, so I made up my mind to climb up that big, wild cherry tree and wait for you till morning. It would be lovely to sleep in a cherry tree all silvery in the moonshine, don't you think?
    Matthew: Oh, yes it would. I mean, no. I mean, there's been a big mistake.
    Anne: Oh, no, there's no mistake; not if you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert. You are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert, aren't you? Mrs. Spencer told me to wait right here for you, and so I've done, most pleasantly I must say. Oh, this is beautiful country you have here, Mr. Cuthbert.
    Matthew: I'm sorry I was late.
    Anne: No, no, that's fine, thank you. It's very light and thin, like me. I better hold on to my bag. If it isn't carried in a certain way, the handle falls off. I mastered the trick of it on my journey. It's a very old carpet bag. Not at all the sort of luggage I imagine the Lady of Shallott would travel with...

    6:00 Anne: I'm overwhelmed.
    Marilla: Matthew Cuthbert, who is that?
    Matthew: It's a girl.
    Marilla: I can see that. Where's the boy?
    Matthew: There weren't any. Just her. I figured we just couldn't leave her there, no matter what the mistake was.
    Marilla: You figured?  Oh, this is a fine kettle of fish. This is what comes of sending word, instead of going ourselves, Matthew.
    Anne: You don't want me? You don't want me because I'm not a boy? Nobody ever did want me. I might have known this was all too beautiful to be true.
    Marilla: Come, come, now. Don't cry. It is not your fault.
    Anne: This is just the most tragical thing that has ever happened to me.
    Marilla: Well, what's your name?
    Anne: Would you please call me Cordelia?
    Marilla: Call you Cordelia?
    Anne: Don't you think it's a pretty name?
    Marilla: Is that your name?
    Anne: Well, no, it's not exactly my name, though I would love to be called Cordelia.
    Marilla: I don't understand what you mean.
    Anne: Cordelia is a perfectly elegant name.
    Marilla: What is your name child, and no more nonsense?
    Anne: Anne Shirley. Plain, old, unromantic Anne Shirley.
    Marilla: Anne Shirley is a fine, sensible name, and hardly one to be ashamed of.
    Anne: Oh, I'm not ashamed, but if you are going to call me Anne, would you please be sure to spell it with an "e".
    Marilla: What difference does it make how it is spelled?
    Anne: It makes a lot of difference. Print out "A-n-n" and it looks absolutely dreadful, but Anne with an "e" is quite distinguished. So if you'll only call me Anne with an "e", I'll try and reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.
    Marilla: Very well then, Anne, with an "e", how is it that you happened to be brought and not a boy?
    Anne: If I were very beautiful and had nut-brown hair, would you keep me?  
    Marilla: No. We have absolutely no use for a girl. Well, don't stand there gaping. Come along; bring your bag. Now that you're here, I suppose we'll have to put you somewhere tonight. Take off your hat. You must be hungry.
    Anne: I can't eat. I can never eat when I'm in the depths of despair.
    Marilla: The depths of despair?
    Anne: Can you eat when you're that way?
    Marilla: I've never been that way.
    Anne: Can't you even imagine you're in the depths of despair?
    Marilla: No, I can not. To despair is to turn your back on God. This is your room for the night. Wash up, and then come down for supper.
    Anne: Yes, Miss Cuthbert.

    Marilla: I'm taking her straight over to that Spencer woman in the morning. This girl has to go straight back to the asylum.
    Matthew: I suppose.
    Marilla: You suppose, don't you know it?
    Matthew: She's a nice little thing, Marilla. Seems a pity to send her back; she's so set on staying.
    Marilla: Matthew Cuthbert, I believe this child has bewitched you. I can see plain is plain you want to keep her.
    Matthew: We could hire a boy, and she can be company for you.
    Marilla: I'm not suffering for company, particularly a girl who prattles on without stopping for breath. She's no good for us. She has to go straight back where she came from.
    Matthew: Well, we might be of some good to her.

    Marilla: Good night, Anne with an "e".
    Anne: You don't have to say goodnight. It's the worst night I've ever known.
    Marilla: Good night, just the same, child.
    Anne: Goodnight. Miss Cuthbert.

    Clip 1:
    0:00 OK. So, tonight I'm going to be reviewing the 2004 film adaptation of the Phantom of the Opera. I've loved Phantom of the Opera since I was probably 13 or 14 years old. I saw the movie when I was 14. I've loved the story since I first saw Lon Chaney, launching his portrayal of Erik, the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, the silent version [..] in 1928, 1928? [..] I'm not really sure.

    But I loved that film. I really did. I'm a huge .. I love silent film, absolutely do. I think they're very underrated in our generation.

    And then I discovered that it was a book. So I read the book. Took me quite a while to read the book. Because it's very .. dull, to be perfectly honest. It's a detective novel. And, it's also a gothic romance. But I finally finished it. I really do. I really do like the book. I have to read it again, because I'm kind of rusty on my knowledge of the book version.

    And there've been several .. million versions of the Phantom of the Opera. And, .. But I'm going to be reviewing the 2004 one. Just because, it's kind of, besides the silent film one, it's one of the better versions. At least of the musical. Because the other versions before that weren't adaptations of the musical.

    So like I said, I first saw it in theaters when I was 14 years old, when it came out. And I fell in love with it. Watching it recently, you know, I'm older, I can appreciate film more and some of the flaws that they have. There are quite a few things about the 2004 one that I don't like. 

    Number one: 

    Clip 2:
    0:00 [..] I'll pretty much say right off the bat, that I am not a humongous fan of musicals. Now there are a lot of Disney films that I've seen that I pretty much not only like, but also adore, that [..] also like have a lot of musical numbers and .. But, you know, that's because, you know, I can let them pass and [..] because they're family films. It's pretty much .. I can almost kind of let it go.

    But when it comes to live-action musicals I basically just dodge them whenever I can, because basically I want the film to be, I mean, especially when it's more adult .. I don't want to watch, you know, the story just being, you know, being postponed for like a few minutes just so someone can just sing something. I mean, sure, I mean, again, sure there can be times when [..] there is actually a plot which is being told in the song. But aside from that, it's almost to me, kind of like, filler.

    So, basically, why did I watch, why am I reviewing Phantom of the Opera? Because I saw the movie. Why did I see the movie? Because the thing is, I watched this film like on Christmas break, and I basically had nothing better to do. Literally, nothing better to do with my time.

    So I watched it and I think, because I was thinking, you know, from what I've heard of Phantom of the Opera, it probably seems like it's going to be a different kind of musical. So, maybe I'll probably give it a chance. Maybe, who knows, maybe I'll like it.

    And do I like it? Could have been worse. But, obviously this is a review and I need to be a little more in depth. So, let's just talk about it. Obviously I'm reviewing specifically the 2004 version of Phantom of the Opera.

    Clip 3:
    1:15:10 Erik: Listen to this.
    Christine: You let me go, I will return.
    Erik: You want to leave. But why, why? [..] Believe me. In my heart, I'm good. Now that you are safe, my work is done. Now I want to live like all the others. I want to have a woman and walk with her on Sundays. Our life will begin now. Believe me. Only love me. Don't be afraid. I live to be loved, to be good.

    Erik: All right. You wanted to see it. See it. Look at me. Look at me. Don't turn around. Look at me. You want to see what's behind it?  Perhaps another mask. A mask behind the mask. No, no. You cannot tear this one off. That's me. Me. Me. Me. Give me your hand. Touch it. Touch it. It's me. Me. It's real. It's not a different mask. It's not a different mask. It's me. Me. It's a ghost, who loves you. A ghost that adores you. Ha, ha. Now I must haunt you always.
    Christine: I didn't want to hurt you.
    Erik: Weep for yourself. Up till now, there was a chance I might let you go free, but now since you have seen my face, there's no chance any more. You would leave me forever. A woman that has seen me like this belongs to me. To me. To me. I'll never let you go. Never. Never. We will spend our lives together. You and I.
