# Christmas


## Steps 1-4

- STEP 1: Drs Chang and Bean talk about Christmas.
- STEP 1: Students prepare questions to ask, things to say.
- STEP 3: Groups ask their questions.
- STEP 4: Representatives report their discussion.

## STEP 1. Stories by Dr Chang and Dr Bean

What questions do they ask?

What questions do you want them to ask?

Questions like:

- What do you mean by "Did you wear a tie?"
- Sorry, can you repeat the question?
- How do you spell 'lawyer'?

What do they say?

Things like:

"Let me write that down."
"OK, I think I can remember that."

<!-- (Sandra, while we're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
take time out to write on the board things we say so students can ask them 
themselves.

Also we can collect questions from students that they want us to 
ask each other.) -->

## STEP 2. Dr Bean has had a number of Christmases in Australia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan. Ask him questions.

2 points: Original Question
1 point: Copy-Cat Question, eg 'Have you been to NY', if someone has already asked,
	'Have you been to Los Angeles.'
An extra point if an Original Question is also grammatically correct.

## STEP 2A. 

- I apprehend bad people and maintain law and order.
- I argue someone's case for people who have problems with the law, or with other people. Often money problems are central.
- I help people in bad health, usually following directions of someone with more knowledge of the problem.
- I keep an eye on money coming in and going out of an organization, and analyze the organization's `health.'
- I put information up so lots of people can have easy access to it on their computers.
- I stand in front of a lot of people, usually younger, and try to get them to understand and acquire skills.

Groups of 2: the people sitting next to each other.

## STEP 3. The 20 questions--What's your Christmas? http://www.tedpower.co.uk/games.htm#g13

[What's my Christmas by English teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MILacjy3SPQ)

Notice the use of YN questions.

- Do you work indoors or outdoors? / in a trade or profession? / in a factory or an office?
- Do you work with your hands? Do you wear a uniform? Do you work long hours?
- Do you work from 9-5? Do you work regular hours? Do you work at weekends?
- Do you work with people or machines? Are you in a service industry?
- Do you sell something? Do you earn a lot of money? Must you have good qualifications to do your Christmas?

Write down one question not in this list.

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)

## White Christmas

- [snow before after - Google Search](http://images.google.com/images?q=snow%20before%20after&num=100)



	I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
	Just like the ones I used to know
	Where the treetops glisten
	and children listen
	To hear sleigh bells in the snow

	I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
	With every Christmas card I write
	May your days be merry and bright
	And may all your Christmases be white

## Last Christmas

	Last Christmas I gave you my heart
	But the very next day, you gave it away
	This year, to save me from tears
	I'll give it to someone special

# Thanksgiving and Christmas

## What is the difference between Thanksgiving and Christmas

- [Internet search: Christmas, Thanksgiving, difference](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=christmas+thanksgiving+difference&num=100)

Questions to ask:

(Think of WH questions, YN questions, Tag questions)

- When is X?
- Which is earlier, X or Y?
- What is the difference between X and Y?
- What is X all about?
- What do people do at X?
- What happens at X?
- Who is X important for?
- When did X start?
- What was X originally?

What did your partner say in response to your question?

What did you say/What question did you ask in follow-up to your partner's response?

# Grading

## Talking grades

A grade for English use during the interviews:

	0: No English
	1: Some English
	2: A lot of English

And a grade for the reports:

	0: Minimal effort made
	1: Effort made, but ineffective
	2: Good report

Drs Chang and Bean will circulate around the classroom to keep an eye on the
uncooperative groups and praise the effective groups.

 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

The interviewers report something their partners do or do not do.

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## STEP 2-4 AGAIN 

(with a different partner)

Do it again with the roles swapped.

<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to speak with different people, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)

# The New Year

## New Year's Day Celebrations

- [The key elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAB_BirnDeA)


## New Year's Resolutions

- [New Year's resolution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_year%27s_resolutions)


## Good New Year's Resolutions

- Realistic
- Clear goal
- Public
- Built on a present activity/desire, learn/do more of something you are already learning/doing
- Positively-oriented, rather than focused on stopping some bad activity

## Dr Bean's New Year Resolutions

- Learn to turn the bathroom light off 90 percent of the time
- Before the next semester, finish representing, interpreting & evaluating personal pronouns in question-answering app
	- eg Queen buys her daughter a Christmas card, rather than
	- Queen buys Queen's daughter a Christmas card.

## New Year's Resolutions Followup

How are your New Year's resolutions going?

Dr Bean's (remember?) are going OK, but not perfectly

He still forgets sometimes to turn the light off. And is surprised to see the light on when he goes to the bathroom. He is also surprised even when he has just turned it on.

The app development made significant advances. I can now parse, represent, interpret and evaluate personal pronouns.

eg, Was the Colonel angry when the child called *him*?

But I am getting wrong answers with possessive pronouns:

eg, Was the Colonel angry when the child called him on *his* red phone?
