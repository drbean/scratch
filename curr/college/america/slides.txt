ask each other.) -->

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)
-->

## Grading

A grade for English use during the interviews:

	0: No English
	1: Some English
	2: A lot of English

And a grade for the reports:

	0: Minimal effort made
	1: Effort made, but ineffective
	2: Good report

Drs Chang and Bean will circulate around the classroom to keep an eye on the
uncooperative groups and praise the effective groups.

 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

The interviewers report something their partners do or do not do.

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## STEP 2-4 AGAIN 

(with a different partner)

Do it again with the roles swapped.

<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to speak with different people, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)
