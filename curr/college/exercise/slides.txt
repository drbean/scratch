# Obesity

## What Is Obesity?

- Being fat, but 'fat' is a bad word.
- 'Obese' is a softer, medical word, a euphemism.

# Exercise and food

## Steps 1-4

- STEP 1: Drs Chang and Bean tell their stories.
- STEP 1: Students prepare questions to ask, things to say.
- STEP 3: Groups ask their questions.
- STEP 4: Representatives report their discussion.

## STEP 1. Stories by Dr Chang and Dr Bean

What questions do they ask?

What questions do you want them to ask?

Questions like:

- What do you mean by "Live to eat, eat to live?"
- Sorry, can you repeat the question?
- How do you spell 'obesity'?

What do they say?

Things like:

"Let me write that down."
"OK, I think I can remember that."

<!-- (Sandra, while we're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
take time out to write on the board things we say so students can ask them 
themselves.

Also we can collect questions from students that they want us to 
ask each other.) -->

## STEP 2. Your questions about Obesity, food and exercise!

One person in the group of 2,3 students is A and asks:

- What springs to mind when you hear the word ‘exercise’?
- Why is exercise so important?
- What kind of exercise do you think is best?
- Do you wish you could exercise more?
- Why do many people not exercise?
- Do you think it’s easy or difficult to find time to exercise during the day?
- Do you think people who exercise are happier than those who don’t?
- Do you think there should be a law that requires everyone to exercise?
- Is it more fun to exercise alone or with other people?
- Do you need advice about how to exercise?

Write down one question not in this list?

## One person in the group of 2,3 students is B and asks:

- Do you like exercise?
- Who do you know who exercises a lot?
- What are the bad things about exercise?
- Which exercise would you prefer: jogging, swimming or cycling?
- Is not exercising a crime against your body?
- Do you think the government should do more to ensure everyone exercises?
- How can you adapt the everyday things you do to increase your level of exercise?
- Do you think exercising makes your brain work better?
- What do you think of the idea of having higher hospital charges for those who don’t exercise?
- If exercise makes you live a lot longer, why do so many people not bother to do it?

Write down one question not in this list?

## Interview groups

Groups of 2: the people sitting next to each other.

## STEP 3. The interview

Question 1:

	1.

Question 2:

	1.

Question 3:

	1.

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)
-->

## Grading

A grade for English use during the interviews:

	0: No English
	1: Some English
	2: A lot of English

And a grade for the reports:

	0: Minimal effort made
	1: Effort made, but ineffective
	2: Good report

Drs Chang and Bean will circulate around the classroom to keep an eye on the
uncooperative groups and praise the effective groups.

 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

The interviewers report something their partners do or do not do.

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## STEP 2-4 AGAIN 

(with a different partner)

Do it again with the roles swapped.

<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to speak with different people, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)
