# The 9-21 earthquake

## Steps 1-4

- STEP 1: Drs Chang and Bean tell their stories.
- STEP 1: Students prepare questions to ask, things to say.
- STEP 3: Groups tell their stories.
- STEP 4: Representatives report their discussion.

## STEP 1. Stories by Dr Chang and Dr Bean

What happened to them? Did they die? Were they injured, but survived? Did they escape unscratched?

What questions do they ask?

What questions do you want them to ask?

Questions like:

- What do you mean by "Did you die?"
- Sorry, can you repeat the question?
- How do you spell 'tremor'?

What do they say?

Things like:

"Let me write that down."
"OK, I think I can remember that."

<!-- (Sandra, while we're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
take time out to write on the board things we say so students can ask them 
themselves.

Also we can collect questions from students that they want us to 
ask each other.) -->

## STEP 2. Your questions about the 9-21 earthquake

[Earthquake pictures](http://images.google.com/images?q=9-21%20earthquake&num=100)

Can you remember it?

One person in the group of 2,3 students is an interviewER. 

WRITE DOWN 3 questions each that you can ask the interviewEEs.

Others in the groups of 2,3 students are interviewEEs. 

WRITE DOWN 3 things you are going to tell the interviewERs.

## Interview groups

Groups of 3 taken from the same or similar groups of 6 that did the job interviews.

## STEP 3. The interview

Question 1:

	1.

	2.

Question 2:

	1.

	2.

Question 3:

	1.

	2.

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)
-->

## Grading

A grade for English use during the interviews:

	0: No English
	1: Some English
	2: A lot of English

And a grade for the reports:

	0: Minimal effort made
	1: Effort made, but ineffective
	2: Good report

Drs Chang and Bean will circulate around the classroom to keep an eye on the
uncooperative groups and praise the effective groups.

 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

The interviewers report the memories of their interviews

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## STEP 2-4 AGAIN 

(with a different disaster that the interviewer experienced)

The interviewERs interviewed

Do it again with the roles swapped.

Now is the chance of the 2 interviewEES to put the interviewER on the spot.


<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to swap roles, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)

# Role play

## Earthquake at Yuda

The building we are now in collapses.

One out of 3 dies.  

One out of 3 survives but is severely injured.  

One out of 3 escapes unscratched.

Which person suffers which fate?

## The helpless foreigner

You don't speak Chinese and you have never experienced an earthquake and you have no idea of what to do. You are not very frightened, because you don't think you are going to be injured or die. But you need help to get out of the building.

## The frightened teacher

You remember the 9-21 Earthquake and are very afraid because you were injured in it and members of your family died. You speak English well, but you don't know what to do, because you have never taken natural disaster training courses, because you were in the US when they were held.

## The well-prepared student

You are frightened because you know that some people are likely to die and be injured. You have taken natural disaster training courses so you have an idea of what to do. You need to tell the people you are with what to do. But you don't speak English.

## Earthquake at Yuda AGAIN

The building we are now in collapses.

Two out of 3 die.

One out of 3 survives but is severely injured.  

Which person suffers which fate?

## Earthquake at Yuda AGAIN AGAIN

The building we are now in collapses.

All 3 die.
