You choose. You are going to interview and be interviewed for a job.

Dr Chang and Dr Bean will walk around and collect your ideas for the ideal job.

# The ideal job interview 

## Steps 1-4

- STEP 1: Drs Chang and Bean show how to do it.
- STEP 1: Students prepare questions to ask, things to say.
- STEP 3: Interviewers interview interviewees.
- STEP 4: Interviewers report their choice of candidate.

## STEP 1. Role play by Dr Chang and Dr Bean of the interview

What position are they interviewing for?

What questions do they ask?

What questions do you want them to ask?

Questions like:

- What do you mean by "clean driver's license?"
- Sorry, can you repeat the question?
- How do you spell your name?

What do they say?

Things like:

"Let me write that down."
"OK, I think I can remember that."

<!-- (Sandra, while we're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
take time out to write on the board things we say so students can ask them 
themselves.

Also we can collect questions from students that they want us to 
ask each other.) -->

## STEP 2. Your questions

Some groups of 2,3 students are interviewERs. 

WRITE DOWN 3 questions each that you can ask the interviewEEs.

Other groups of 2,3 students are interviewEEs. 

WRITE DOWN 3 things you are going to tell the interviewERs.

## The interview preparation

3 interviewers interview 3 candidates in turn for the job.

Drs Chang and Bean assign groups to interviewER and interviewEE roles.

## STEP 3. The interview

Candidate 1:

- Reasons why this candidate should get the job.

	1.

	2.

- Reasons why this candidate should NOT get the job.

	1.

	2.


Candidate 2:

- Reasons why this candidate should get the job.

	1.

	2.

- Reasons why this candidate should NOT get the job.

	1.

	2.

 

Candidate 3:

- Reasons why this candidate should get the job.

	1.

	2.

- Reasons why this candidate should NOT get the job.

	1.

	2.

<!--
(Sandra, while they're interviewing each other, it might be a good idea to 
walk around making sure they are speaking English, giving advice, asking 
questions, checking understanding, etc.)
-->
 
## STEP 4. After the interview--the report

One representative for the group of 3 interviewers reports the candidate they chose with reasons.

<!--
(Sandra, we can collect cards with the reports and read them out, and/or 
ask students to stand up and report.)
-->

## The interviewERs interviewed

Do it again with the roles swapped.

Now is your chance to put the interviewERs on the spot.

<!--
(Sandra, depending on the time, we can just do STEPs 1-4 again.
I think it is a good idea to swap roles, so at least doing STEP 3 is a good thing.)

I think it is unlikely that the students will use English to do
the exercise on page 17 in the textbook, asking each other interview questions.

1. However, if we think of a job that they would really like to have
and for which they would have to interview in English, then they
might be willing to practice for it with a partner using English.

Question: What is some job they would be willing to practice in English
for?

2. Also, an activity that might work is getting them to suggest
(possibly tough) questions that you can ask me and/or I can ask you.

3. I remember an activity from Gillian Porter Ladousse, Role Play,
Resource books for teachers. Oxford:

One group, who are interviewers, prepares questions to ask.
The other group are interviewees. I forgot what they do.

But before they get a chance to do the role play, the teacher
switches the roles.

The interviewees-to-be ask the questions, as interviewers.
The interviewers-to-be become the interviewees.

I remember this working well, but with much higher level
students.

4. Groups of 3 interviewers interview 3 interviewees in turn and
   pick one. They have to report the reasons they chose one than
   the others.

Question: Do the students have groups already in this class?
