    Please look at the following three pictures. Listen to the following short talk.
    What sport are the people probably playing?
    The best player just made a slam dunk. The crowd is cheering loudly for her. But, now the other team has the ball and is trying to make a basket.

    27.
    What is the boy going to do this afternoon?
    Hi, Dave, this is John. Do you want to meet me this afternoon? I am going to be at the park near your house. I just got some new soccer shoes, so I'd like to practice kicking the ball into the net before the big game on Sunday. It would be fun to kick the ball around with you too. I'll be there around 1:00 p.m. Hope to see you there.

    28.
    What is the woman talking about?
    I'm really glad you came to the game with me. That guy is the best pitcher on the team. He throws the ball so fast and so hard. Almost no one can hit it. And that player over there is brand-new, but he's supposed to be a really good batter.

    29.
    What does Susan like to do in her free time?
    I love going up to the mountains every weekend during the winter. I don't mind the cold at all. Skiing and playing in the snow are my favorite things to do. It's too bad winter only lasts a few months. I wish it lasted the whole year.

    30.
    What is the woman's hobby?
    When I am under a lot of stress, my favorite way to relax is through art. I use different colors to show how I feel. When I'm done, I feel great. Once it's all dry, I also have something beautiful to hang on my wall.
