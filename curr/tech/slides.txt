## Grading 

http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/cclass

## Aim of class

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

The class is big. Is there some area that everyone here
needs to know about?

## Finding something everyone in the class needs to know

A difficult process:

Group writes list of topics they want to learn English for
Class classifies topics into 2-3 areas
Each student joins area group to discuss area topics
Class decides on 3 areas for 3 sessions of the course

## Exam 1: Week 5
H1-706

How many words that you got wrong in the homework can you get right on the night?

Australian theater slang: She'll be right on the night. = Don't worry, be happy.

## Students who didn't do the homework get 3/5 if they come and answer 180 words on the quiz

Others get 3-5.

The student who improves the greatest scores 5.

Assuming she/he gets 50 words right that she/he got wrong in the homework, the student who gets 25 wrong words right scores 4.

4 = 3 + 2 * 25/50

_____(1) that combined _____(2) and computing were first _____(3) in 1973, and were offered for _____(4) beginning in 1993. The term _____(5) first _____(6) in
1997, when _____(7) described its GS 88 as one.

The _____(8) mobile phone to incorporate _____(9) features was an IBM _____(10) developed in 1992 and _____(11) that year at and industry _____(12) show. A
refined version of the product was _____(13) to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon. The _____(14) was the first device that can be
_____(15) to as a "smartphone". Simon could make and receive cellular phone calls and send and receive faxes and e-mails through a touch screen _____(16).

In the late 1990s, many mobile phone _____(17) carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of _____(18) such as Palm OS, BlackBerry OS or
Windows CE/Pocket PC. These would later evolve into mobile OSes.

In 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 which became their _____(19) phone of that time. It was a palmtop computer-style phone combined with a PDA from HP. In early
prototypes, the two devices were fixed together via a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design. When opened, the display was on the inside top surface and with
a physical QWERTY keyboard on the bottom. Email and text-based web browsing was provided by the GEOS V3.0 operating system.

In June 1999, Qualcomm released a "CDMA Digital PCS Smartphone" with integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity, known as the "pdQ Smartphone".^[12]

In early 2000, the Ericsson R380 was released by Ericsson Mobile Communications,^[13] and was the first device marketed as a "smartphone".^[14] It combined the
functions of a mobile phone and a personal digital assistant (PDA), supported limited web browsing with a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus.^[15]

## Talking about learning
by talking about computers.

It is difficult to talk about our own learning directly. But if we talk about computers, we talk indirectly about our own learning.

## Session 2

learning 180 most common words from Academic Word List

## Academic Word List

http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/

## Words you need to know if you are going to study in the US

Words most native speakers don't use every day but are necessary
if you read academic books or listen to profs talk

## Academic words

assume
authority	
available
benefit 
concept 
consist
constitute 
context
contract
create
data

## Procedure: pre-test post-test

Pretest: Homework Week 6 translate 180 words into Chinese

+ Week 6, 7, 8, 9
After doing pretest, learn the words with Anki or Mnemosyne

+ Week 9 (Midterm)
Again translate the same 180 words into Chinese

The difference between your score on the pre-test and the post-test
is your grade for the midterm (worth 5 points).

## Pretest

Don't use a dictionary. Give your best answer for the translations 
of the 180 words.

You must write something for each word.

## Problem

The more correct answers you have now, the harder it is 
to have a big increase in number of correct answers after
using Anki and Mnemosyne.

I offer the students who already have finished entering many
words the opportunity to

1. enter the words again, or
2. do sublists 7, 8, and 9.

If you know all the words in sublists 1, 2 and 3 already,
you will choose option 2.

If you used the dictionary to fill in the words, you will
choose option 1.

## Advice

It is OK to guess. You HAVE to guess if you don't know
the word.

If you cheat and look in the dictionary or ask someone,
you hurt your grade in the midterm.

## == Email sent to students

1. Finish the 179 words from the exercise linked at http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/AFN3Y0.html
before Sunday lunchtime.

	At the moment,
	Sat Nov  2 11:50:17 CST 2013
	the standings are as below.

Your score in the exam will be the increase in the number of answers which are 
right between your answers now and your answers then.

If you've only done 12 answers, your maximum score is 12.

If you've done 179 answers, your maximum possible score is 179.

2. Install anki http://ankisrs.net, or mnemosyne http://mnemosyne-proj.org
and download the files:

	Dr Bean has uploaded decks of cards to the 2 projects' web pages.

	</ul>

3. The correct answers are as given by Google Translate and there are problems in its 
answers.

	For example, for 'minor,' it gives: minor: 未成年人
	That is only one meaning, and probably not the most important one.

	In any case, this will be regarded as the right answer in the exam. All others 
	will be regarded as incorrect. Sorry.

## Youtube self-introductions

In week 10 homework some people uploaded a self-introduction

Dr Bean was a student. ==  [Exists x1 conj[student[x1],x1==B]]

There exists an entity, such that:
it was a student, ie student[x1] was True
and it equaled B.

## Evaluation

Put in all the entities in Model.hs and see if the formula's true

afld_students    = [A,C,D,J,K,M,N,R,S,V]
other_students = [JS,VS,VT]
students = afld_students ++ other_students

## Bett WH questions

Who was a teacher?
Who was a student?
Who are students?
Who were students?
Who were some students?

Who was the student whose grandmother was a farmer?
Whose grandmother was a farmer?
Who was the student who had a cat?
Who was the student whose cat was Mi Mi?
Whose cat was Mi Mi?

## Problem questions

Did a student have a farmer?

+ Doesn't make sense, but Bett says:
	Jeff had a grandmother
	and the grandmother was a farmer,
	so Jeff had a farmer.

## Problem questions with 'a', 'the'

relatives = [

	, "Who was the man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was a man who was a student?"
	, "Who was the man who was a student?"

, "Was Mindy born in Hsinchu?"
, "Wasn't Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Kelly born in Hsinchu."
, "Did Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Neil didn't born in Hsinchu."

Who wasn't born in Hsinchu?

## Question competition

Each group helps champion write a question, 
using words from the list and an assigned 
question form, WH, YN or Tag, or grammar form.

An answer is also written.

## Q and A evaluation

The question's grammaticality and the 
correctness of the answer are then evaluated.

Perhaps we ask that the question and answer 
be evaluated by Bett, by logging on under 
the champion's ID.

Or perhaps the 2 groups evaluate the 
question and answer, with unresolvable
disagreements about grammaticality and the 
answer adjudicated by Dr Bean.

## Deciding winner

After each champion presents a number (the same
number) of questions and answers, the 2 
groups vote on the winner.

They list their reasons for their vote on 
the form.

## Question competition + assigned grammar structure

The champion comes to the board with a grammar structure
which the opponent will follow, asking a question.

It must be different to a prior grammar structure.
If the grammar structure is ungrammatical, the group
gets a second chance.

The champions write questions and answers on the board.
Dr Bean evaluates the grammaticality of the questions
and the correctness of the answers and awards points.

## Bett grammar structures

## Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

No books, notes
It's OK to talk.
Ask:	Alex, Cindy, Dave, Jeff, Kelly, 
	Mindy, Neil, Rena, Shane, Vicky

It's OK to look at their videos on youtube.

## Preparation for Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers
