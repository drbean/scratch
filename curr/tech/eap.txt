English for academic purposes (EAP) entails training students, usually in a higher education setting, to use language _____(13) for study. It is a challenging and multi-faceted _____(4) within
the wider field of English language learning and teaching (ELT), and is one of the most common forms of English for specific purposes (ESP).

An EAP program _____(15) instruction on skills _____(1) to perform in an English-speaking academic _____(3) across _____(12) subject _____(4) generally encountered in a university setting. Programs may also include a more narrow _____(15) on the more _____(2) linguistic demands of a particular _____(4) of study, for example business subjects. Programs may be divided into pre-sessional courses and courses taken alongside students' other subjects. In the former case, sometimes EAP courses may be intended to raise students' general English levels so that they can enter university. In the UK, this often means endeavoring to help students get a score of 6 or above in the IELTS examination. 
In the US, this can mean helping students _____(8) a score of 80 or greater on the TOEFL or
more than 4 on the iTEP. Outside Anglophone countries, English-_____(7) universities may have a preparatory school where students can spend a year or two working on their English and academic
skills before starting degree courses. EAP courses running alongside other degree courses may be based on the American English and Composition model, or may employ Content-based instruction,
either using material from the students' degree subjects or as an independent, elective-like course. These in-sessional courses may be desirable more to help students develop study skills and
_____(1) academic practices than for language development.

In common with most language teaching, EAP instruction teaches vocabulary, grammar and the four skills (reading, writing, speaking - including pronunciation - and listening), but usually tries
to tie these to the _____(2) study needs of students; for example, a writing lesson would _____(15) on writing essays rather than, say, business letters. Similarly, the vocabulary chosen for study
tends to be based on academic _____(16). In addition, EAP _____(9) often find that, either directly or indirectly, they are teaching study skills and often having to tackle differences in
educational _____(14), such as differing attitudes to plagiarism. This trend has become more prominent as the numbers of foreign students attending UK universities, and other institutions
across the Anglo-_____(6), has increased over the last _____(10)

There is some debate amongst EAP teachers as to the best way to help students with academic English.On the one hand, students might be taught particular conventions but not expected to
understand why they need to _____(11) their writing; a pragmatic _____(5). On the other hand students might be encouraged to challenge writing conventions and only adopt them if they seem justified; a critical _____(5). Recently attempts have been made to try and reconcile these opposing views. A critical pragmatic _____(5) to EAP encourages students to develop writing conventions _____(1) by universities while also encouraging them to think about the reasons why these conventions exist.
