Vocabulary List In Medical Science English Language Essay
http://www.ukessays.com/essays/english-language/vocabulary-list-in-medical-science-english-language-essay.php

The idea of an academic vocabulary has a long history in teaching English for academic or specific purposes Indeed, academic vocabulary is used to refer to items which are reasonably frequent in

a wide range of academic genres but are relatively uncommon in other kinds of texts (Coxhead & Nation, 2001).

Many university-level structures regard helping students develop control over such vocabularies as an important part of their role, and attempts have been made to assemble lists of key terms to

guide materials writers and help students plan their learning more efficiently. Early ESP materials, for example, sought to identify and present forms with a high frequency in scientific and

technical writing (e.g., Barber, 1988; Herbert, 1965) and considerable effort has been devoted to investigating the vocabulary needed for academic study (e.g., Campion & Elley, 1971; Coxhead,

2000; Nation, 1990). Such research is usually based on the assumption that learners are seeking to build a repertoire of specialized academic words in addition to their existing basic or general

service vocabulary, and this repertoire building is often seen as the purpose of developing university vocabulary. 

2. Literature review

Vocabulary is typically seen as falling into three main groups (Nation, 2001):

High frequency words such as those included in West’s (1953) General Service List (GSL) of the most widely useful 2,000-word families in English, covering about 80% of most texts.

An academic vocabulary of words which are reasonably frequent in academic writing and comprise some 8%–10% of running words in academic texts.

A technical vocabulary which differs by subject area and covers up to 5% of texts.

ESL/EFL students are said to find an academic vocabulary a particularly challenging aspect of their learning (Li & Pemberton, 1994). This aspect of their learning is challenging because,
although technical vocabulary is central to students’ specialized areas, general academic vocabulary serves a largely supportive role and the words are “not likely to be glossed by the content
teacher” (Flowerdew, 1993, p. 236). Many of these words also occur too infrequently to allow incidental learning (Worthington & Nation, 1996), encouraging researchers and teachers to develop
vocabulary lists for directly teaching these terms.
