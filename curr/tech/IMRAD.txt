IMRAD

   The IMRAD (/ˈɪmræd/) _____(14) is the most prominent norm for the _____(14) of a scientific _____(12) article of the original 
   _____(15) type. IMRAD is an acronym for introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Original _____(15) articles are typically 
   structured in this basic order:
     * Introduction - Why was the study undertaken? What was the _____(15) question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the 
     _____(15)?
     * Methods - When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups 
     (patients, etc.)?
     * Results - What answer was found to the _____(15) question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
     * and
     * Discussion - What might the answer _____(7) and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? 
     What are the perspectives for future _____(15)?

   Besides original-_____(15) articles, other _____(1) types of article include literature reviews, case reports, case series, and 
   meta-_____(5), which usually use non-IMRAD structures.
The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of academic journals since the first half of the 20th century. The 
IMRAD _____(14) has come to _____(13) academic writing in the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine.^^^ The _____(14) of 
most public health _____(12) articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD _____(14) originates in the empirical sciences, it now 
also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide _____(2) of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only 
prefer this _____(14) but also use the IMRaD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the 
use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the "Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals" issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (previously 
called the Vancouver guidelines): The _____(3) of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) 
divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called “IMRAD” _____(14) is not an 
arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the _____(8) of scientific discovery. Long articles may need 
subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case 
reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.^

   The IMRAD _____(14) is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American 
   Psychological Association (APA style).^ The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the social, educational and 
   behavioral sciences.^

Benefits[edit]

   The IMRAD _____(14) has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more 
   quickly to _____(9) material _____(17) to their purpose.^ But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual _____(4) of 
   events or ideas of the _____(15) presented; the IMRAD _____(14) effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary 
   detail, and allow the reader to _____(10) a well-ordered and noise free presentation of the _____(17) and _____(16) 
   information. It allows the most _____(17) information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by 
   summarizing the _____(15) _____(8) in an ideal _____(4) and without unnecessary detail.

Caveats[edit]

   The idealised _____(4) of the IMRAD _____(14) has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a 
   radio talk in 1964 the Nobel laureate Peter Medawar even criticised this instructive _____(3) _____(14) for not giving a 
   realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: "... the scientific paper may be a fraud because it 
   misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper".^ Medawar's 
   criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1965.^^ It is probably a bit too much 
   to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire _____(8) of scientific 
   discovery.
   But Medawar's caveat was sensible as a response to how many students and faculty throughout academia have sometimes treated it 
   as such a panacea. Medawar and others have given eloquent testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.

Abstract considerations[edit]

   In addition to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, 
   however, be composed to _____(6) as an autonomous _____(3) , even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost 
   integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the 
   increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability 
   for an article to be found by its optimal readership.^ Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal 
   requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical 
   content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract.^ Such abstracts are often referred to as "structured 
   abstracts".^ The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and information overload has led 
   some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due _____(11) to the abstract.
