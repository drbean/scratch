    00:28 Will: You brought this misery on us, Locksley.
    Robin: This is Nottingham, trying to divide us.
    Will: We are divided, rich boy. I'm not as blind as that old man over there. You're still trying to be lord of the manor. I heard today that the sheriff now values your neck at five hundred gold pieces. I say we take him in!
    Robin: Will, do you think that the sheriff will give everything back after I'm gone?
    Will: They'll give us the reward and our pardons.
    Robin: Wrong. He'll stretch your necks one by one.
    Will: Well, what will you have us do? Fight armored men on horseback with rocks and our bare hands?
    Robin: If needs be. But with the one true weapon that escapes you, Will. Courage.
    Wulf: Look out!

    Robin: Thank you, Wulf.

    You wish to end this? You wish to go home? Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves!  And face that the price worth may be dear. But I for one would rather die and spend my life in hiding. The Sheriff calls us outlaws, but I say we are free! And one free man defending his home is more powerful then ten hired soldiers. The Crusades taught me that. I will make you no promises, save one: That when you truly believe in your hearts that you're free then I say we can win!

    This is the story of Robin Hood. You can read along with me in your book. You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this. Let's begin now.
    Long ago, England was ruled by the wicked, greedy Prince John. He ordered the Sheriff of Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.

    01:59
    One day, Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn't notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest --- the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see Little John and Robin Hood watching from a tree. "Look at all that gold. Hey! Little John, let's pay Prince John a little visit! In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject. "Gold... beautiful gold! Life has been so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely, and he missed out on all this lovely gold. How I love gold!"

    Robin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune-tellers when the coach passed by. "Care to have your fortune told, Your Majesty?" "Fortune-tellers! How droll! Stop the coach!" While Robin Hood told Prince John's fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the prince's gold. Prince John never even knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John had escaped.

    Second clip

    Robin Hood and Little John, walking through the forest,
    Laughing back and forth at what the other one has to say.
    Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.
    Never ever thinking there was danger in the water,
    They were drinking, they just guzzled it down.
    Never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse,
    Was a-watching them and gathering around.
    Robin Hood and Little John, running through the forest,
    Jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away.
    Contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.

    Little John: You know something, Robin? You're taking too many chances.
    Robin Hood: Chances? You must be joking! That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
    Little John: Yeah? Take a look at your hat. That's not a candle on a cake.
    Robin Hood: Hello! This one almost had my name on it, didn't it? They're getting better, you know. You've got to admit it! They are getting better.
    Little John: Yeah, the next time that sheriff will probably have a rope around our necks! Pretty hard to laugh hanging there, Rob!  
    Robin Hood: Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground. En garde!
    Little John: Hey, watch it, Rob. That's the only hat I've got.
    Robin Hood: Oh, come along. You worry too much, old boy.
    Little John: You know something, Robin? I was just wondering. Are we good guys or bad guys? You know. I mean, our robbing the rich to feed the poor.
    Robin Hood: Rob? That's a naughty word. We never rob. We just sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
    Little John: Borrow? Boy, are we in debt.

    Narrator: Many, many years ago, in 16th century Spain, in an area known as La Mancha, there lay a quiet little village. And in the village, there was a large estate that belonged to a middle-aged gentleman, named Alonso Quijano.
    Instead of taking care of his estate like most other gentlemen of the time, Alonso Quijano preferred to read books about chivalry, about knights in shining armor. And the more he read, the more he envied the knights of old. They led such exciting lives. He imagined that he could be a brave knight on a fast steed riding through the land, protecting maidens in distress and slaying dragons and monsters. 
    Don Quixote: Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Yes sir? May I help you?
    Don Quixote: Sancho, I will become a brave knight, and you my squire. We will ride through the land and uphold justice for all.
    Narrator: He was very serious. He changed his name to Don Quixote and wore his great-grandfather's armor. He then mounted a common plough horse and named it Rocinante. And along with his faithful squire, he was ready for his first adventure as a knight.
    The next morning as the sun was shining brightly over the farmland of the village, there suddenly appeared a knight in shining armor and his squire riding through the countryside. Everyone stopped their work to have a look at this strange sight. They just couldn't believe their eyes.
    Don Quixote: Sancho, there is much to do. We must push on. The work of a brave knight is never done.
    Narrator: Don Quixote and Sancho had reached the end of their first day without incident. But Don Quixote dreamed of the adventures to come as they rode into the night.
    The people in the village thought that Don Quixote's behavior was very peculiar.
    Don Quixote and Sancho continued their ride through the countryside. And suddenly, What a lovely girl!
    Don Quixote: Beautiful maiden! Let me introduce myself. I am Don Quixote.
    Aldonza:  Hello. I'm Aldonza. Why have you dressed so strangely?
    Don Quixote: Strangely?  Huh. Why, I am the brave knight of La Mancha.
    Aldonza: Oh, so you're the man I've been hearing about. Is there some kind of unrest in the land that has caused you to become a knight?
    Don Quixote: Unrest? Why, there is much injustice. Yes.
    Narrator: Aldonza gave him a rose. She realized that he was quite harmless. Our brave knight is a real gentleman.
    Our heroes were soon on their way. Don Quixote was overjoyed at finding a beautiful maiden to protect. As they said farewell, he decided to rename her Dulcinea. The next morning, Don Quixote and Sancho were sleeping soundly beneath a large tree when suddenly ...
    Don Quixote: Oh? Huh. An enemy army approaching. Come, Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Master, master!
    Narrator: As the dust cleared. Don Quixote and Sancho could see two groups of animals galloping to the center of the field.
    Don Quixote: The enemy attack!
    Narrator: Don Quixote charged. But wait! They're only sheep. Not to Don Quixote. He imagined an enemy army and he went into action.
    Don Quixote: Where are you? Show yourselves. Come out and fight like men. You sniveling cowards. Come on! [unintelligible] evil doers. All of you! Let's go! Come on!
    Narrator: Don Quixote has fallen from his horse. Is he all right?
    Don Quixote: Come on! Keep coming! I'll take you all on, you scoundrels. Don't run. Aha! Take that. Let's go. I'll take you! Come on!

    Mother: I've got to get her some warm clothing. Is Mr Chisolm standing by?
    Father: Listen. Everyone else has abandoned ship. We're the only ones left on board.
    Joanna: Is the ship sinking, Papa?
    Father: No, Joanna.
    Mother: What happens now?
    Father: Well, it's too dark to see anything. We'll have to wait until morning before we assess the situation. But since we appear to be in no immediate danger, I think we should all get as much rest as possible.
    Father: I'll take first watch, son.
    Christina: I hope Bruno and the other animals are all right.
    Mother: They will be, dear.
    Ernst: The following morning, the family struggled up on deck. Disillusioned, afraid. But so far, we had survived. We were fully expecting to be surrounded by miles and miles of ocean. Everyone was surprised by what we actually saw. We could hardly believe our eyes.
    Joanna: What land is that, Papa?
    Father: I have no idea, Joanna. But it's beautiful. Perhaps it's a peninsula of some kind.
    Mother: We should never have left Boston.
    Christina: What if there are cannibals?
    Mother: Oh, really Christina!
    Christina: But I've read about them, Mama.
    Mother: Then you're reading the wrong sort of book, young lady.
    Christina: There weren't any cannibals in Boston.
    Father: Christina, that's quite enough.
    Joanna: How do we get to shore without a boat?
    Ernst: We could use life rings.
    Father: No, I think what we need to do is to put together something that will float, some sort of a raft.
    Mother: Do you know how to build one?
    Father: Well, no, I don't. But I shall have to try.
    Ernst: The first thing that Father and I did was to go down to the master's cabin and survey the chart for our last-known position.
    Ernst: Well I heard Mr Blake saying that we were being blown south.
    Father: Well, whichever way we were blown, there's no land marked here.
    Christina: All right, Bruno. Just calm down.
    Ernst: Christina was more interested in finding Bruno and checking if the other animals were still alive.
    Christina: What do you think, Bruno. Do we save them, or not?
    Bruno: Woof! Woof!
    Christina. I agree. I do need my egg for breakfast.
    Ernst: While Father and I set about trying to build a raft, Mother and Joanna searched for anything that could be of use. Although neither of them had ever undertaken such hard manual work, between them they managed to haul onto the deck all of the trunks and chests.
    Mother: Well, at least we will be clothed. And not want for food for a while.

    Second clip:
    Mother: How do you know so much?
    Emily: My grandmother was a healer. She knew a lot about herbs. When I was a little girl, she used to teach me.
    Christina: Mother, we saw three goats. One was a baby, a kid.
    Joanna: I saw them too.
    Ernst: Come down from the mountains, it would seem.
    Father: I think we may have manufactured a rudder that actually works.
    Mother: Does that mean that we will soon be able to set sail from here?
    Father: I wouldn't be too certain of that yet, my dear.
    Emily: My father will be mounting a search for me.
    Father: I'm sure he will. But it may take some time. After all. No-one knows where we are. In the meantime, we must take heart and continue to help and support one another.
    Joanna: Tell that to Emily. You said she was to help me. I've asked her again and again. But she refuses.
    Father: Emily, is this true?
    Emily: Billy would do work for me.
    Billy: Yes sir, I will.
    Father: No, he will not. Billy has his own work to do. Emily, under these circumstances, it is very important that we all cooperate with one another. And that means that you must do your work along with everyone else.
    Emily: I am not a servant.
    Father: No, you're not. But if you don't work, you don't eat. You understand that?
    Emily: Well, I'm not hungry.
    Ernst: Little did we realize at the time, that Emily's selfishness and even the volcano would pale in comparison with the enormous danger that lay ahead.

    Ben: Volcano's belching again.
    Parsons: Pay no attention to the volcano. Study the raft.
