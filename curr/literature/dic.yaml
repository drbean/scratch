    00:28 Will: You brought this misery on us, Locksley.
    Robin: This is Nottingham, trying to divide us.
    Will: We are divided, rich boy. I'm not as blind as that old man over there. You're still trying to be lord of the manor. I heard today that the sheriff now values your neck at five hundred gold pieces. I say we take him in!
    Robin: Will, do you think that the sheriff will give everything back after I'm gone?
    Will: They'll give us the reward and our pardons.
    Robin: Wrong. He'll stretch your necks one by one.
    Will: Well, what will you have us do? Fight armored men on horseback with rocks and our bare hands?
    Robin: If needs be. But with the one true weapon that escapes you, Will. Courage.
    Wulf: Look out!

    Robin: Thank you, Wulf.

    You wish to end this? You wish to go home? Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves!  And face that the price worth may be dear. But I for one would rather die and spend my life in hiding. The Sheriff calls us outlaws, but I say we are free! And one free man defending his home is more powerful then ten hired soldiers. The Crusades taught me that. I will make you no promises, save one: That when you truly believe in your hearts that you're free then I say we can win!

    This is the story of Robin Hood. You can read along with me in your book. You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this. Let's begin now.
    Long ago, England was ruled by the wicked, greedy Prince John. He ordered the Sheriff of Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.

    01:59
    One day, Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn't notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest --- the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see Little John and Robin Hood watching from a tree. "Look at all that gold. Hey! Little John, let's pay Prince John a little visit! In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject. "Gold... beautiful gold! Life has been so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely, and he missed out on all this lovely gold. How I love gold!"

    Robin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune-tellers when the coach passed by. "Care to have your fortune told, Your Majesty?" "Fortune-tellers! How droll! Stop the coach!" While Robin Hood told Prince John's fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the prince's gold. Prince John never even knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John had escaped.

    Second clip

    Robin Hood and Little John, walking through the forest,
    Laughing back and forth at what the other one has to say.
    Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.
    Never ever thinking there was danger in the water,
    They were drinking, they just guzzled it down.
    Never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse,
    Was a-watching them and gathering around.
    Robin Hood and Little John, running through the forest,
    Jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away.
    Contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day,
    Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day.

    Little John: You know something, Robin? You're taking too many chances.
    Robin Hood: Chances? You must be joking! That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
    Little John: Yeah? Take a look at your hat. That's not a candle on a cake.
    Robin Hood: Hello! This one almost had my name on it, didn't it? They're getting better, you know. You've got to admit it! They are getting better.
    Little John: Yeah, the next time that sheriff will probably have a rope around our necks! Pretty hard to laugh hanging there, Rob!  
    Robin Hood: Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground. En garde!
    Little John: Hey, watch it, Rob. That's the only hat I've got.
    Robin Hood: Oh, come along. You worry too much, old boy.
    Little John: You know something, Robin? I was just wondering. Are we good guys or bad guys? You know. I mean, our robbing the rich to feed the poor.
    Robin Hood: Rob? That's a naughty word. We never rob. We just sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
    Little John: Borrow? Boy, are we in debt.

    Narrator: Many, many years ago, in 16th century Spain, in an area known as La Mancha, there lay a quiet little village. And in the village, there was a large estate that belonged to a middle-aged gentleman, named Alonso Quijano.
    Instead of taking care of his estate like most other gentlemen of the time, Alonso Quijano preferred to read books about chivalry, about knights in shining armor. And the more he read, the more he envied the knights of old. They led such exciting lives. He imagined that he could be a brave knight on a fast steed riding through the land, protecting maidens in distress and slaying dragons and monsters. 
    Don Quixote: Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Yes sir? May I help you?
    Don Quixote: Sancho, I will become a brave knight, and you my squire. We will ride through the land and uphold justice for all.
    Narrator: He was very serious. He changed his name to Don Quixote and wore his great-grandfather's armor. He then mounted a common plough horse and named it Rocinante. And along with his faithful squire, he was ready for his first adventure as a knight.
    The next morning as the sun was shining brightly over the farmland of the village, there suddenly appeared a knight in shining armor and his squire riding through the countryside. Everyone stopped their work to have a look at this strange sight. They just couldn't believe their eyes.
    Don Quixote: Sancho, there is much to do. We must push on. The work of a brave knight is never done.
    Narrator: Don Quixote and Sancho had reached the end of their first day without incident. But Don Quixote dreamed of the adventures to come as they rode into the night.
    The people in the village thought that Don Quixote's behavior was very peculiar.
    Don Quixote and Sancho continued their ride through the countryside. And suddenly, What a lovely girl!
    Don Quixote: Beautiful maiden! Let me introduce myself. I am Don Quixote.
    Aldonza:  Hello. I'm Aldonza. Why have you dressed so strangely?
    Don Quixote: Strangely?  Huh. Why, I am the brave knight of La Mancha.
    Aldonza: Oh, so you're the man I've been hearing about. Is there some kind of unrest in the land that has caused you to become a knight?
    Don Quixote: Unrest? Why, there is much injustice. Yes.
    Narrator: Aldonza gave him a rose. She realized that he was quite harmless. Our brave knight is a real gentleman.
    Our heroes were soon on their way. Don Quixote was overjoyed at finding a beautiful maiden to protect. As they said farewell, he decided to rename her Dulcinea. The next morning, Don Quixote and Sancho were sleeping soundly beneath a large tree when suddenly ...
    Don Quixote: Oh? Huh. An enemy army approaching. Come, Sancho.
    Sancho Panchez: Master, master!
    Narrator: As the dust cleared. Don Quixote and Sancho could see two groups of animals galloping to the center of the field.
    Don Quixote: The enemy attack!
    Narrator: Don Quixote charged. But wait! They're only sheep. Not to Don Quixote. He imagined an enemy army and he went into action.
    Don Quixote: Where are you? Show yourselves. Come out and fight like men. You sniveling cowards. Come on! [unintelligible] evil doers. All of you! Let's go! Come on!
    Narrator: Don Quixote has fallen from his horse. Is he all right?
    Don Quixote: Come on! Keep coming! I'll take you all on, you scoundrels. Don't run. Aha! Take that. Let's go. I'll take you! Come on!

    Mother: I've got to get her some warm clothing. Is Mr Chisolm standing by?
    Father: Listen. Everyone else has abandoned ship. We're the only ones left on board.
    Joanna: Is the ship sinking, Papa?
    Father: No, Joanna.
    Mother: What happens now?
    Father: Well, it's too dark to see anything. We'll have to wait until morning before we assess the situation. But since we appear to be in no immediate danger, I think we should all get as much rest as possible.
    Father: I'll take first watch, son.
    Christina: I hope Bruno and the other animals are all right.
    Mother: They will be, dear.
    Ernst: The following morning, the family struggled up on deck. Disillusioned, afraid. But so far, we had survived. We were fully expecting to be surrounded by miles and miles of ocean. Everyone was surprised by what we actually saw. We could hardly believe our eyes.
    Joanna: What land is that, Papa?
    Father: I have no idea, Joanna. But it's beautiful. Perhaps it's a peninsula of some kind.
    Mother: We should never have left Boston.
    Christina: What if there are cannibals?
    Mother: Oh, really Christina!
    Christina: But I've read about them, Mama.
    Mother: Then you're reading the wrong sort of book, young lady.
    Christina: There weren't any cannibals in Boston.
    Father: Christina, that's quite enough.
    Joanna: How do we get to shore without a boat?
    Ernst: We could use life rings.
    Father: No, I think what we need to do is to put together something that will float, some sort of a raft.
    Mother: Do you know how to build one?
    Father: Well, no, I don't. But I shall have to try.
    Ernst: The first thing that Father and I did was to go down to the master's cabin and survey the chart for our last-known position.
    Ernst: Well I heard Mr Blake saying that we were being blown south.
    Father: Well, whichever way we were blown, there's no land marked here.
    Christina: All right, Bruno. Just calm down.
    Ernst: Christina was more interested in finding Bruno and checking if the other animals were still alive.
    Christina: What do you think, Bruno. Do we save them, or not?
    Bruno: Woof! Woof!
    Christina. I agree. I do need my egg for breakfast.
    Ernst: While Father and I set about trying to build a raft, Mother and Joanna searched for anything that could be of use. Although neither of them had ever undertaken such hard manual work, between them they managed to haul onto the deck all of the trunks and chests.
    Mother: Well, at least we will be clothed. And not want for food for a while.

    Second clip:
    Mother: How do you know so much?
    Emily: My grandmother was a healer. She knew a lot about herbs. When I was a little girl, she used to teach me.
    Christina: Mother, we saw three goats. One was a baby, a kid.
    Joanna: I saw them too.
    Ernst: Come down from the mountains, it would seem.
    Father: I think we may have manufactured a rudder that actually works.
    Mother: Does that mean that we will soon be able to set sail from here?
    Father: I wouldn't be too certain of that yet, my dear.
    Emily: My father will be mounting a search for me.
    Father: I'm sure he will. But it may take some time. After all. No-one knows where we are. In the meantime, we must take heart and continue to help and support one another.
    Joanna: Tell that to Emily. You said she was to help me. I've asked her again and again. But she refuses.
    Father: Emily, is this true?
    Emily: Billy would do work for me.
    Billy: Yes sir, I will.
    Father: No, he will not. Billy has his own work to do. Emily, under these circumstances, it is very important that we all cooperate with one another. And that means that you must do your work along with everyone else.
    Emily: I am not a servant.
    Father: No, you're not. But if you don't work, you don't eat. You understand that?
    Emily: Well, I'm not hungry.
    Ernst: Little did we realize at the time, that Emily's selfishness and even the volcano would pale in comparison with the enormous danger that lay ahead.

    Ben: Volcano's belching again.
    Parsons: Pay no attention to the volcano. Study the raft.

    Waldman: "How do you do? Mr. Carl Laemmle feels that it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning. We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein. a man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image, without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation, life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So, if any of you feel you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain. now is your chance to, .. er ..  Well, we have warned you!" 

    Second clip:
    Frankenstein: Dr Waldman, I learned a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray, the ultra-violet ray, that you said was the highest color in the spectrum. You were wrong. Here in this machine, I have gone beyond that. I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
    Waldman: Oh. And your proof?
    Frankenstein: Tonight, you shall have your proof. But first, I experimented only with dead animals, and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks. But now I am going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.
    Waldman: And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
    Frankenstein: That body is not dead. It has never lived. I created it. I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere. Go and see for yourself.

    Quite a good scene, isn't it? One man crazy. Three very sane spectators.

    Look! It's moving. It's alive. It's alive....It's alive, it's moving, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive! Oh - in the name of God. Now I know what it feels like to be God.

    Third clip:
    Father: You stay here, Maria. I'll just take a look at my traps. Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
    Child: You won't be long, Daddy?
    Father: Oh, no. If Franz comes by, tell him I'll be back soon.
    Child: Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
    Father: I'm too busy, darling. You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
    Child: Bye, daddy.
    Father: Bye. Be a good girl now.
    Child: Come on, kitty.
    Child: Who are you? I'm Maria.

    Child: Will you play with me?
    Child: Would you like one of my flowers?
    Child: You have those, and I'll have these.

    Frederick: Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts myself, but this is excellent.
    Igor: Who are you talking to?
    Frederick: To you. You just made a yummy sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
    Igor: I didn't make a yummy sound, I just asked you what it is.
    Frederick: But you did. I just heard it.
    Igor: It wasn't me.

    Doctor: Yes, you're right, Mrs Corney
    Bumble: I wonder where she [...]. Her shoes were worn to pieces.
    Doctor: No wedding ring. I see. The old story. Another mouth for the orphanage?
    Bumble: Until he's old enough for the orphanage, I'll be father and mother to him.

    4:20 Bumble: Now, you mind your manners.
    Oliver: Ow!
    Bumble: Good day, gentlemen.
    Limbkins: What's your name, boy?
    Oliver: Oliver Twist.
    Limbkins: What? Who gave you that name?
    Bumble: I did, sir. You see, I name my orphans according to a little invention of my own. For the given names, according to the month. The surnames, according to the alphabetical order in which they arrive. If it's in July, it's 'James' or 'John,' and so on. Now this lad, here, came in October, 'O' for 'October,' 'O' for 'Oliver.' He was the twentieth that came that year. The twentieth letter of the alphabet is 'T.' 'T' for 'Twist.' 'O' for 'Oliver,' "T' for 'Twist.' I called him 'Oliver Twist.' Simple, ain't it? Of course, I've lots of trouble with the 'X's and the 'Z's.
    Limbkins: We understand, Mr Bumble.
    Limbkins: You know you're an orphan, don't you?
    Oliver:
    Councillor: The boy's a fool. I knew he was.
    Limbkins: You know that you have no father and mother, don't you? That you were brought up by the parish?
    Councillor: What are you crying for?
    Councillor: I hope you say your prayers every night. And pray for the people who take care of you, and feed you.
    Limbkins: You come here to be educated and to learn a useful trade.
    Councillor: And so, tomorrow morning, you begin by scrubbing the floor of the workhouse dining room. And after that ...

    7:50 Master: Say grace. For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Boys: For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Cook: Blimey, he wants more.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Master: Mr Bumble, Mr Bumble!
    Master: Mr Limbkins. Beg pardon, sir. But Oliver Twist has asked for more.
    Limbkins: What? Am I to understand that after he had eaten a generous supper the law allows, he asked for more? Bumble, lock him up.
    Bumble: Yes, sir. You come with me. The boy's an incorrigible, sir. Can't you arrange to apprentice him to someone?
    Limbkins: I will.
    Councillor: That boy will be hanged. I know he will be hanged.

    13:15 Fagin: Well, ahem, I hope you've been working this morning, my dears.
    Mmh. Aren't they lined beautifully. What an ingenious workman! Oliver, wouldn't you like to make pocket handkerchiefs as easily as Charley Bates?
    Oliver: Very much, sir, if you'll teach me.
    Charley: Hee-hee-hee.
    Fagin: My dears, shall we have a little game?
    Dodger: Right-o.

    Oliver: If you please, sir.

    Child: Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
    Father: I'm too busy, darling. You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
    Child: Bye, daddy.
    Father: Bye. Be a good girl now.
    Child: Come on, kitty.
    Child: Who are you? I'm Maria.

    Child: Will you play with me?
    Child: Would you like one of my flowers?
    Child: You have those, and I'll have these.
    Child: I can make a boat. See how mine floats?

    Child: Monster: Oh, oh.
    Child: Oh, you're hurting me. No!
 
    Oliver Twist

    4:20 Bumble: Now, you mind your manners.
    Oliver: Ow!
    Bumble: Good day, gentlemen.
    Limbkins: What's your name, boy?
    Oliver: Oliver Twist.
    Limbkins: What? Who gave you that name?
    Bumble: I did, sir. You see, I name my orphans according to a little invention of my own. For the given names, according to the month. The surnames, according to the alphabetical order in which they arrive. If it's in July, it's 'James' or 'John,' and so on. Now this lad, here, came in October, 'O' for 'October,' 'O' for 'Oliver.' He was the twentieth that came that year. The twentieth letter of the alphabet is 'T.' 'T' for 'Twist.' 'O' for 'Oliver,' "T' for 'Twist.' I called him 'Oliver Twist.' Simple, ain't it? Of course, I've lots of trouble with the 'X's and the 'Z's.
    Limbkins: We understand, Mr Bumble.
    Limbkins: You know you're an orphan, don't you?
    Oliver:
    Councillor: The boy's a fool. I knew he was.
    Limbkins: You know that you have no father and mother, don't you? That you were brought up by the parish?
    Councillor: What are you crying for?
    Councillor: I hope you say your prayers every night. And pray for the people who take care of you, and feed you.
    Limbkins: You come here to be educated and to learn a useful trade.
    Councillor: And so, tomorrow morning, you begin by scrubbing the floor of the workhouse dining room. And after that ...

    7:50 Master: Say grace. For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Boys: For what we are about to receive, Lord, make us truly thankful. Amen.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Cook: Blimey, he wants more.
    Oliver: Please, sir. I want some more.
    Master: Mr Bumble, Mr Bumble!
    Master: Mr Limbkins. Beg pardon, sir. But Oliver Twist has asked for more.
    Limbkins: What? Am I to understand that after he had eaten a generous supper the law allows, he asked for more? Bumble, lock him up.

    13:15 Fagin: Well, ahem, I hope you've been working this morning, my dears.
    Mmh. Aren't they lined beautifully. What an ingenious workman! Oliver, wouldn't you like to make pocket handkerchiefs as easily as Charley Bates?
    Oliver: Very much, sir, if you'll teach me.
    Charley: Hee-hee-hee.
    Fagin: My dears, shall we have a little game?
    Dodger: Right-o.
    Fagin: Just to amuse Oliver.
    Dodger: Right-o.
    Fagin: Hey, Oliver?

    First clip:
    Narrator: There are things in this world worth fighting and dying for. We're warriors. It's who we are. It's what we do.
    Mickey: The three musketeers. I came to Paris to be one of you.
    Narrator: d'Artagnan, you want to be a musketeer? This is your chance. We live in a kingdom controlled by fear. The cardinal rules the land. Buckingham rules the skies. [..] And she is the deadliest assassin the world has ever seen. Together they will unleash war on the entire continent.
    Mickey: We're the musketeers. It's up to us to put an end to the cardinal's plot.
    Goofy: I can do with some exercise.
    Mickey, Goofy: Donald: All for one. And one for all.

    Second clip:
    Comte de Rochefort: [...] someone riding a buttercup. Unless it is a cheese, with legs. 
    d'Artagnan: Tell me what you laugh at, sir, and we will laugh together, if you speak to me.
    Comte de Rochefort: If you were a gentleman, I would speak to you. I was speaking at you, sir.
    d'Artagnan: But I am speaking to you, sir. Turn if you are a man, and see you laugh now.
    Comte de Rochefort: He's a Gascon.
    Follower: Shall I cut his throat?
    Comte de Rochefort: No, put him on his ridiculous horse and let him go.

    Comte de Rochefort: No time to talk, my lady. The cardinal commands you to England. You are to let him know the moment the Duke of Buckingham leaves London.
    Milady de Winter: And then?
    Comte de Rochefort: Await his further orders.
    Milady de Winter: And you? When shall I see you again?
    d'Artagnan: You? You assassin. I shall chastise you, sir. Forgive me, madam, but I must kill your friend.
    Milady de Winter: Are you not terrified?
    Comte de Rochefort: Ha! Away, bumpkin! You will hear from me.
    Kitty: He's very handsome.
    [...]
    Comte de Rochefort: Lord, pay the bill.

    Third clip:
    Musketeers: All for one. And one for all.
    Narrator: There are three: Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

    1:35 Athos: Only a fool would try to arrest us twice in one day.
    Jussac: You're under arrest.
    Aramis, Pathos: A fool.
    Jussac: Are you coming peacefully, or do you intend to resist?
    Porthos: Oh, don't be so stupid. Of course we intend to resist. Just give us a moment, all right?
    Porthos: Five of them, three of us. Hardly seems fair.
    Aramis: Perhaps we should give them a chance to surrender.
    d'Artagnan: Excuse me, but there's four of us.
    Athos: It's not your fight. You're not a musketeer.
    d'Artagnan: I may not wear the tunic. But I believe I have the heart of a musketeer.
    Porthos: Warrior.
    Aramis: Poet.
    Athos: You got a name, boy?
    d'Artagnan: d'Artagnan.
    Athos: Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
    Porthos: Hello.
    d'Artagnan: Nice to meet you again.
    Aramis; A pleasure.
    Porthos: Everyone acquainted?
    Porthos: And now we are prepared to resist.

    Fourth clip:
    d'Artagnan: It's the coach. Hurry, Athos. 
    Athos: It is done, d'Artagnan. One tug of the string, and the pistol will explode the flask filled with powder. And, voila, no more bridge.
    d'Artagnan: Good. To your posts. Now, Athos.
    Aramis: Keep your place, coachman, and you will retain your health.
    d'Artagnan: The door is locked from within.
    Aramis: I have a simple solution.
    d'Artagnan: A foolish attempt, messenger. Now I will relieve you of the letter you carry.
    Messenger: You will regret this, musketeer.
    d'Artagnan: We shall see, monsieur.

    Queen Anne: You have done well, my musketeers. This letter from the Duke Duval carries a plan of treachery against the king.
    Constance: Then you will surely expose him for his evil plot, Your Highness.
    Queen Anne: As soon as the king returns from the North, Constance.
    Porthos: Until then, Your Majesty, we will guard you and the letter with our lives.

    Clip 1:
    Helmsman: Captain, there's something in the water off the port bow.
    Captain: I'd say it's a whale, if it weren't so enormous. It's heading toward us. Full right rudder.
    Narrator: Rankin Bass present Festival of Family Classics. [...] From the exciting world of Jules Verne, the thrilling underwater adventure, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. [...]

    Captain: On July 20, 1866, less than eight months ago, the steamer, Governor Higgins sighted what they thought was an unknown reef five miles east of the Australian coast. But as the captain was plotting its position, the reef suddenly spouted two enormous columns of water, and moved away. And then just last month, the Scotia was rammed by something like an enormous whale, leaving a hole in her steel hull in the shape of a perfect triangle. Not only can this thing move at incredible speeds, but we estimate it is at least 355 feet long or at least as large as this ship. Whatever this thing is, monster or machine, we have been commissioned to find it and destroy it, I will pay 2,000 dollars to the man who first sights it.
    Pierre Aronnax: Conrad, are you sure you still want to go?
    Conrad: What? And miss out on history's greatest fishing trip?
    Pierre Aronnax: People don't always come back from expeditions like these.
    Conrad: But those are always other people. I'll take my chances.
    Captain: Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: Yes, Commander?
    Captain: Welcome aboard, Mr Aronnax. It's a pleasure having you and your young assistant with us.
    Aronnax: Thank you, [...]
    Captain: I'd like you both to meet Ned Land, the finest harpooner in all of North America.
    Aronnax: I've heard of you, sir. Your skill is known even in Europe.
    Captain: Well, now all we have to do is find this, er, overgrown whale, or whatever it is.
    Land: Aye, I can't believe it's a whale. I've never seen one that could crack the steel plates of a steamship.
    Captain: What else could it be? No other fish or ship known to man that big or that powerful.
    Aronnax: I'm not so sure, Captain. It could be a giant narwhal.
    Land: What's that?
    Aronnax: It's a rare kind of whale with a long ivory tusk. Kind of a giant unicorn fish.
    Captain: Well, whatever it is, I hope that you'll be able to identify it, Mr Aronnax. And, you, Ned, be able to kill it, before it destroys us.

    Conrad: Look, he caught it.
    Captain: She, Conrad. That's a female porpoise.
    Conrad: She reminds me of my little sister, Fifi. Here, Fifi. 
    Aronnax: Two months. We've sighted nothing but porpoises. It's all very discouraging, Conrad.
    Conrad: We'll be the laughing stock of the world when we get back.
    Aronnax: I know, Conrad. I know.
    Seaman: Ahoy. There she blows.
    Conrad: Look, there.
    Aronnax: That must be it.
    Captain: Man the lifeboat.
    Land: Come on in, monster. Find the end of my harpoon.
    Conrad: It's still coming. Watch out.
    Captain: There goes Ned.
    Seaman: Man overboard.
    [...]
    Conrad: Look out. It's turning. It's going to ram us.

    Aronnax: I don't know how much longer I can hold out, Conrad.
    Conrad: I think I see something, Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: What?
    Conrad: I'm not sure, but I think .. Yes. It's Fifi. Grab hold.
    Aronnax: I wonder where she's taking us.
    Conrad: Maybe to land.
    Aronnax: It must be at least a thousand miles from land, Conrad.
    Conrad: What was that?
    Land: Ahoy.
    Conrad: Ned.
    Land: Welcome aboard, Mr Aronnax.
    Aronnax: What is this?
    Land: Your giant narwhal.
    Aronnax: What? It's man-made.
    Land: Take your hands off me.

    Conrad: Look. Dry clothes.
    Aronnax: Sealskin. And some strange cloth I've never seen before. It almost looks like it was woven from sea grass.
    Land: What do you think they'll do to us?
    Conrad: Feed us.
    Aronnax: Hey, stop.

    Clip 2:
    Captain Nemo: We are taking the Nautilus down for the last time.
    Officer: We understand, sir. And we're with you.
    Land: Wait a minute. I don't understand. What's that got to do with us?
    Nemo: I'm dying, and the Nautilus is dying with me. Professor?
    Aronnax: Yes.
    Nemo: In a matter of minutes, an explosion, such as the world has never known, will destroy my island and all its works forever. That is why I have brought the Nautilus here, to its last, deep resting place. Here at least we will die in peace. Let every man go to his quarters and remain there.
    Land: Why do you take us down with you?
    Nemo: Lock them in their quarters.
    Officer: Aye, sir. Take them out.
    Land: I don't want to die. Don't let him do it. I want no part of this!
    Aronnax: Captain, you cannot do this. There is more at stake here than just our lives. Yours was a dream of the future come true. I beg you to reconsider.
    Nemo: A power greater than mine makes that impossible. But there is hope for the future. When the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass, in God's good time.
    Aronnax: I'm sorry, Ned.
    Land: Don't give up, mates! We're no part of any suicide pact!
    Officer: Put him in his cabin.

    1955 verion:
    1:40 Poole: Dr Jekyll, Dr Jekyll. Are you all right?
    Jekyll: Go away.
    Poole: Please sir, let me in.
    Jekyll: Go away.

    Utterson: Come now, Poole. Either Dr Jekyll has gone or he has not. Now which is it?
    Poole. Well, I don't know, Mr Utterson. I can't say, sir. Oh, it's been a most terrible time, sir. Over two weeks now, he's been locked in his laboratory, won't come out. We put his meals there by the door. Then after we go away, he takes them inside, if he's inside.
    Utterson: Who else could be?
    Poole: Look, sir. Here are two of the prescriptions he left with me only this afternoon. Now, you know Dr Jekyll's handwriting. Is that his hand?
    Utterson: Very odd. Very odd, indeed.
    Poole: Yes, but is it Dr Jekyll's writing?
    Utterson: Well, yes and no. I should say that under great stress he might write like this.
    Poole: Begging your pardon, sir. I think it's the other.
    Utterson: The other? What other?
    Poole: Oh, you know, sir. You'll remember him. His friend. Hyde, his name was.
    Utterson: But Hyde disappeared a year ago. He wouldn't dare to return with the police after him.
    Poole: I believe he's back, sir. And I believe he's done something to Dr Jekyll.
    Utterson: We should pay a visit to Mr Hyde. If it is he.
    Poole: Yes, sir. I should bring a pistol, sir, if I went into that room.
    Utterson: Yes. You may be right. After all, he is a murderer. I could never understand why Jekyll took up with him. 
    Poole: I think it was what you might call an experiment, sir. Dr Jekyll knew some very strange people.
    Utterson: Even murderers?

    Utterson: I say, [..], are you inside?
    Jekyll: Go away.
    Utterson: Utterson, it's your friend, Utterson. Now let me in, like a good chap.
    Jekyll: Leave this house.
    Utterson: That's not Dr Jekyll's voice.
    Poole: I was right, sir. There's someone else in there.
    Utterson: Do you think it's Hyde?
    Poole: Sounds like him.
    Utterson: If it's you, Hyde, let us in or we'll force the door. All right, Poole.
    Utterson: All right, now. Where are you?
    Poole: He's dead, sir.
    Utterson: Yes. It was Hyde, wasn't it?
    Poole: Yes, sir. It was Mr Hyde. Do you think he's killed Dr Jekyll?
    Utterson: I don't know. I want you to go to the police. Tell them the murderer, Hyde has been killed. I shall wait for the police here.
    Poole: Yes, sir.
    Utterson: George Utterson, Esquire. To be opened in the event of my death or disappearance. Henry Jekyll.
    Jekyll: When you read this, dear friend, I shall be dead. And only this journal will remain to clarify a mystery, to exert a warning. You will recall perhaps a conversation we had two years ago when you came to see me and you found Dr Lanyon and me arguing.
    Lanyon: My dear Jekyll, you astonish me. A grown man like you talking like a romantic boy.
    Jekyll: Lanyon, We are scientists. In theory, nothing is impossible. 
    Lanyon: That may be true, but some things are clearly improbable. Your idea's too fantastic.
    Poole: Mr Utterson to see you, sir.
    Jekyll: We're having a row.
    Utterson: Oh. So, shall we go to law?
    Jekyll: No, we might need your fine legal mind to arbitrate.
    Lanyon: Jekyll here has decided to go beyond science, leaving me far behind. I am only a doctor. A simple, ordinary doctor.
    Jekyll: Like me.
    Utterson: No. You're not simple, and you're not ordinary.
    Lanyon: Do you know what this outrageous fellow proposes to do?
    Utterson: Raise the dead?
    Lanyon: Better than that. He wants to find the soul. He wants to play with it, to experiment upon.
    Jekyll: [..] I merely suggested one way of discovering the nature of the soul would be to dissect it the way you would any other organism. 
    Utterson: I was under the impression the soul was not tangible.
    Jekyll: Neither is the air, but we know it exists. We can alter it. See? Fire. We're burning oxygen. This match is creating carbon dioxide. We've altered a substance no-one can see. Why not the soul?
    Utterson: Why not indeed. But where do you find it?
    Jekyll: In the mind, I should think. Which parts of the mind which regulate behavior. If I were to take up this poker, dear Lanyon, and kill you.
    Lanyon: Well, I wouldn't put it past you. You're as mad as a hatter.
    Jekyll: I should suffer terrible pangs of conscience afterwards. That would be my sole punishment.
    Utterson: There is a small matter of the law, you know.
    Jekyll: All right. But suppose the mind could be so changed that I could strike Lanyon to the ground and feel nothing. Only pleasure in a violent act. And there is something in all of us, that caged beast, which delights in horror and destruction.
    Utterson: The whole idea is far too fanciful 
    Lanyon: And slightly unwholesome.
    Jekyll: Utterson, I helieve I'm on the track of something quite fantastic.
    Utterson: The soul?
    Jekyll: The soul. Good and evil. I believe it's possible artificially to produce either a monster or an angel in the same man.
    Lanyon: Rubbish. Where's my tea. I came here for tea, not a Black Mass.
    Jekyll: You'll have your tea, my old intolerant friend.
    Lanyon: Monster or an angel.
    Utterson: Do you really believe that human beings are both?
    Jekyll: I do.

    1941 version:
    Poole: Dr Jekyll, that frightful maniac broke into the house. Did he attack you, sir?
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Policeman: Which way did he go, sir? Out there?
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Poole: I didn't even know you were at home, sir. Are you badly hurt?
    Jekyll: No, I'll be all right.
    Policeman: This door here is locked. We'd better go out that way.
    Jekyll: Yes.
    Lanyon: Wait. There. Heaven help him.
    Higgins: But I know this gentleman. He's Dr Jekyll.
    Lanyon: I know. Nevertheless, there's your man.
    Poole: I'm sorry, sir, but I know Dr Jekyll. I've known him for years.
    Higgins: This is your master, isn't it.
    Poole: Of course, sir. No doubt about it, sir.
    Higgins: Then we must have lost him. Come, men.
    Lanyon: No, no, no. Wait. Tell them, Jekyll. Tell them. It's no use, Jekyll. You know it's no use. Tell them what happened. I beg of you, Jekyll. Tell them who you are. Tell them what you've done.
    Jekyll: I've done nothing. I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll. I've done nothing. I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll, I tell you. I've done nothing. You're looking for a man named Hyde. Hyde. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll. I'm Dr Jekyll, I tell you. I tell you, I'm Dr Jekyll. I'm Dr Henry Jekyll.
    Higgins: It's no use, Jekyll. You'd better come quietly.
