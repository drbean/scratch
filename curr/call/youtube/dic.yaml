    Rena: My name is Rena. My Chinese name is Dai RuiXuan.  My favorite things are the color pink, Hello Kitty and cats. This is my cat "Mi Mi". And I think I have a very optimistic personality and I'm a very easygoing person as well. I am pretty outgoing but sometimes still shy with strangers. About my interests, I like to listening to music. I usually listen to English songs to learn English. My favorite  singer is Avril Lavigne. My ambition is... I hope I can work in America in the future, and meet a lot of foreigners so that I can improve my English ability. Thank you for listening.

    My name is Nina Chen. I'm twenty years old now. My hometown is in Tainan. But now I live in Miaoli to study. There are five people in my family, my father, mother and my two older sisters.

    I seldom go back to Tainan because the ticket is too expensive. And it also takes a long time to get there by by train. As a result, I only go back to Tainan during summer and winter breaks.

    By the way, now, I'm working at 7-11 outside the school. I study at Yuda University as a sophomore. My major is Applied English. And English has always been my favorite subject. I'm also looking forward to learning more English.

    My interests are watching movies, listening to music and playing computer games. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the class. Bye.
