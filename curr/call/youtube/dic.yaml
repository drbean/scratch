    Rena: My name is Rena. My Chinese name is Dai RuiXuan.  My favorite things are the color pink, Hello Kitty and cats. This is my cat "Mi Mi". And I think I have a very optimistic personality and I'm a very easygoing person as well. I am pretty outgoing but sometimes still shy with strangers. About my interests, I like to listening to music. I usually listen to English songs to learn English. My favorite  singer is Avril Lavigne. My ambition is... I hope I can work in America in the future, and meet a lot of foreigners so that I can improve my English ability. Thank you for listening.
