# 網路英文, or Internet English 電腦多媒體語言教學, or Computer- & Multimedia-Assisted Language Learning

## The Internet as a way to learn English

- Pros:
	- Same experience as in US.

- Cons:
	- Unnatural, not as close, intimate as face-to-face. No body language.
	- Communication is narrow, restricted.
	- Disables learners. Like blind people,
	learners-  have to use machines to work around their disability.
	- Breaks easily. Not permanent. Web pages disappear. It's harder to lose books or CD's.

## Identity on the Internet

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog
- 
- 'dog' can have many meanings: good, as in the cartoon
- 
- or bad: eg, it can mean an ugly woman or man:
- 
- http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dog
- 
- What identity do you have on the Internet?
- What character do you portray on the Internet?

## Internet use

- Finding information
- Facebook
- Keeping in touch
- Chat
- Playing games

-	ESL chat rooms (text, not skype)
-	Internet surveys?
-	Blogs eg Twitter (no Facebook)

## What do you use the Internet for?

Write it on the board.

## Aim of class

Really excited: My own teaching computers, multimedia

Students will:
1) experience computer/multimedia language teachers,
2) criticize existing software in the market,
3) and make material for others to use
	in computer/multimedia language learning.

## Microsoft: No Powerpoint

## Software you can change. Open-source, free software

## consumers, critics, producers

## 4 sessions
	dictation:	Weeks 1-5
	flash cards:	Weeks 5-8
	youtube videos:	Weeks 9-13
	parsing:	Weeks 13-17

## Talking about learning
by talking about computers.

It is difficult to talk about our own learning directly. But if we talk about computers, we talk indirectly about our own learning.

## Flashcards

Mnemosyne http://mnemosyne-proj.org

## Anki introduction

http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2G-k2hQyg&feature=plcp

## Problems with flashcards

* Non-contextualized (just single words)
* Language-focused (not communication-focused),
	so meaningless
* Every repetition is the same (no change in the presentation)
	but in the real world, the presented word always changes
## Session 2

learning 180 most common words from Academic Word List

## Academic Word List

http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/

## Words you need to know if you are going to study in the US

Words most native speakers don't use every day but are necessary
if you read academic books or listen to profs talk

## Academic words

assume
authority	
available
benefit 
concept 
consist
constitute 
context
contract
create
data
define


## Procedure: pre-test post-test

Pretest: Homework Week 6 translate 180 words into Chinese

+ Week 6, 7, 8, 9
After doing pretest, learn the words with Anki or Mnemosyne

+ Week 9 (Midterm)
Again translate the same 180 words into Chinese

The difference between your score on the pre-test and the post-test
is your grade for the midterm (worth 5 points).

## Pretest

Don't use a dictionary. Give your best answer for the translations 
of the 180 words.

You must write something for each word.

## Problem

The more correct answers you have now, the harder it is 
to have a big increase in number of correct answers after
using Anki and Mnemosyne.

I offer the students who already have finished entering many
words the opportunity to

1. enter the words again, or
2. do sublists 7, 8, and 9.

If you know all the words in sublists 1, 2 and 3 already,
you will choose option 2.

If you used the dictionary to fill in the words, you will
choose option 1.

## Advice

It is OK to guess. You HAVE to guess if you don't know
the word.

If you cheat and look in the dictionary or ask someone,
you hurt your grade in the midterm.

## == Email sent to students

1. Finish the 179 words from the exercise linked at http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/AFN3Y0.html
before Sunday lunchtime.

	At the moment,
	Sat Nov  2 11:50:17 CST 2013
	the standings are as below.

Your score in the exam will be the increase in the number of answers which are 
right between your answers now and your answers then.

If you've only done 12 answers, your maximum score is 12.

If you've done 179 answers, your maximum possible score is 179.

2. Install anki http://ankisrs.net, or mnemosyne http://mnemosyne-proj.org
and download the files:

	Dr Bean has uploaded decks of cards to the 2 projects' web pages.
	</br>

	At <href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org">Mnemosyne</a>:

	<li><a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/node/318">Sublist 2 for Mnemosyne</a>
	<li><a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/node/319">Sublist 3 for Mnemosyne</a>

	<li><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3916546620">Sublist 3 for Anki</a>
	</ul>

	Or download the cards from Dr Bean's site as text files and import them yourselves.

	<ul>

	<li><a href="http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/call/awl_freq_1.txt">Sublist 3 as text file</a>
	</ul>

3. The correct answers are as given by Google Translate and there are problems in its 
answers.

	For example, for 'minor,' it gives: minor: 未成年人
	That is only one meaning, and probably not the most important one.

	In any case, this will be regarded as the right answer in the exam. All others 
	will be regarded as incorrect. Sorry.

## Youtube self-introductions

In week 1 homework some people uploaded a self-introduction
to youtube.

The self introductions are good.

## What should your partner talk about in her/his self-intro

Ask her. Tell her. Write it on the board.

## Youtube self-introduction problems


Make sure the self-introduction is not private. Make it public.

I want everyone to have their own id. Dave and Miu-Miu's videos are
uploaded using the same id. Don't do that. Don't upload someone's video
for them. Everyone must do it themselves.

## Self-introductions not uploaded

Do it before next week (next Tuesday morning 8am, March 4), or lose points
You are preventing your group from doing the homework
for week 2.

Parsing--Is it grammatical
Transformation--From grammar into logic
Evaluation--Is the logical statement True or False

## Parsing

S = NP + VP
NP = DET + CN | dr_bean
VP = V + O | V + to + VP

Dr Bean was a student.

             dr_bean was a student
		/        \
          dr_bean      was a student
                         /    \
                     was     a student
                             /   \
                            a     student

## Parsing on the computer

Branch  Cat S[Thrd,Masc,Sg][]   [
        Leaf (Cat dr_bean NP[Masc,Sg,Thrd,Nom][]),
Branch  Cat VP[Pos,Sg][]        [
        Leaf (Cat was COP[Pos,Sg][Cat NP[][]]),
Branch  Cat COMP[][]    [
Branch  Cat NP[MascOrFem,Sg,Thrd][]     [
        Leaf (Cat a DET[Sg][]),
        Leaf (Cat student CN[Thrd,MascOrFem,Sg][])]


## Translation

From language to a math formula

Dr Bean was a student. ==  [Exists x1 conj[student[x1],x1==B]]

There exists an entity, such that:
it was a student, ie student[x1] was True
and it equaled B.

## Evaluation

Put in all the entities in Model.hs and see if the formula's true

afld_students    = [A,C,D,J,K,M,N,R,S,V]
other_students = [JS,VS,VT]
students = afld_students ++ other_students

## Bett WH questions

Who was a teacher?
Who was a student?
Who are students?
Who were students?
Who were some students?

Who was the student whose grandmother was a farmer?
Whose grandmother was a farmer?
Who was the student who had a cat?
Who was the student whose cat was Mi Mi?
Whose cat was Mi Mi?

## Problem questions

Did a student have a farmer?

+ Doesn't make sense, but Bett says:
	Jeff had a grandmother
	and the grandmother was a farmer,
	so Jeff had a farmer.

## Problem questions with 'a', 'the'

relatives = [
	"Who was a man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was the man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was a man who was a student?"
	, "Who was the man who was a student?"
	]

## Bett passive questions

"Mindy was born in Hsinchu."
, "Neil wasn't born in Hsinchu."
, "Was Mindy born in Hsinchu?"
, "Wasn't Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Kelly born in Hsinchu."
, "Did Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Neil didn't born in Hsinchu."

Who wasn't born in Hsinchu?

## Question competition

Each group helps champion write a question, 
using words from the list and an assigned 
question form, WH, YN or Tag, or grammar form.

An answer is also written.

## Q and A evaluation

The question's grammaticality and the 
correctness of the answer are then evaluated.

Perhaps we ask that the question and answer 
be evaluated by Bett, by logging on under 
the champion's ID.

Or perhaps the 2 groups evaluate the 
question and answer, with unresolvable
disagreements about grammaticality and the 
answer adjudicated by Dr Bean.

## Deciding winner

After each champion presents a number (the same
number) of questions and answers, the 2 
groups vote on the winner.

They list their reasons for their vote on 
the form.

## Question competition + assigned grammar structure

The champion comes to the board with a grammar structure
which the opponent will follow, asking a question.

It must be different to a prior grammar structure.
If the grammar structure is ungrammatical, the group
gets a second chance.

The champions write questions and answers on the board.
Dr Bean evaluates the grammaticality of the questions
and the correctness of the answers and awards points.

## Bett grammar structures

Tag question	= NP + VP + Tag
		DET + CN + VP + Tag
		Dr Bean  + VP + Tag
		NP  +  V + O + Tag
		NP + V + to + VP + Tag

NP		= Name
		DET + CN
		DET + ADJ + CN
		NP + 's + CN
		DET + V + ing
		DET + CN + RelCL
		DET + CN + of + NP

DET		= all | some | the | a | zero

RelCL		= that + S | who + S | S
		PrepP

VP		= was | wasn't | were | weren't + COMP
		V
		V + NP
		V + PrepP
		V + NP + NP
		V + NP + PrepP
		V + to + VP

COMP		= NP | ADJ | PrepP

## Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

No books, notes
It's OK to talk.
Ask:	Alex, Cindy, Dave, Jeff, Kelly, 
	Mindy, Neil, Rena, Shane, Vicky

It's OK to look at their videos on youtube.

## Preparation for Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

Running out of simple questions, try: more difficult questions

## 1: Questions with 'who', 'that', which are not WH questions, 

	Who was the woman who was born in hsinchu
	, "Was a sister who Dave had a student?"
	, "Was Dave's sister a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister who was a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister?"

## 2: Questions with determiners other than 'a,' 'the,'

Did mindy have some sisters?
Was some sister of shane a student?
Were all sisters of shane students? Yes??

## Homework Week 3: Transcribing partner's self-introductions

A transcribes B's self-introduction
B transcribes C's self-introduction
C transcribes A's self-introduction

Do the first 150 words.

## What did you say in your self-introduction?

Tell her/him.
Ask her/him.

## Transcribing procedures

Divide the video transcript into 3 lines, like this:


Greg: I'm really excited about this multimedia and computer language teaching class. It's something I've always .. I've been doing. I've been trying to teach using computers and also some multimedia. And so it's great to have the chance to talk about that in this class that I'm doing. I'm really looking forward to it.

Greg: Uh, language teaching using multimedia. What is the class about? It's about, uh, using, uh, it's about .. learning, of course. Learning using computers. And I want to do that. I want you to experience using multimedia to learn English and experience using computers to learn English. Uh, like a consumer. Be a consumer of, uh, multimedia language teaching, a consumer of Computer-Assisted Language Learning. 

Greg: But not just be a consumer, because, uh, the class is about language teaching. I want you to be a critic, also, of your experience as a consumer. I want you to tell us what you think. Is this a good program? Is this a good way to learn English? This software, is it useful? Or, which is better? This program, or that program? So, that's just not being consumers, but also being critics of software.

With the name of the speaker, eg Greg:
