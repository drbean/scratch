## The Internet as a way to learn English

- Pros:
	- Same experience as in US.

- Cons:
	- Unnatural, not as close, intimate as face-to-face. No body language.
	- Communication is narrow, restricted.
	- Disables learners. Like blind people,
	learners-  have to use machines to work around their disability.
	- Breaks easily. Not permanent. Web pages disappear. It's harder to lose books or CD's.
