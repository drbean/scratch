  - The meaning of smiles in the US and Germany

    Track 1:
    0:52 Erica Gingerich: What form of non-verbal communication matters most in business?

    Robert Gibson: Just to take one example, perhaps, um, it'd be good to talk about smiling. This seems very simple. Human beings smile all over the world. But they actually smile at different times and the smiling has a different meaning in different countries.

    One has to avoid over-generalization, but there's a frequently-experienced difference between the USA and Germany, as to when people smile.

    Researchers say that actually there's a different attitude to smiling. Let's just look at what smiling really means in those two countries.

    I think in Germany, people smile for a reason. And they often say about the Americans, Ah, people smile all the time. This is superficial. This is actually insincere, or maybe even dishonest.

    And if you talk to Americans about Germans, they can often say, Ah, the Germans are really unfriendly. When I go in the service encounter, a shop or I'm doing business, they never seem to smile.

    Now, what's the reason for this? I think in Germany, the smile is something reserved for a particular occasion, or has a particular cause. There is a reason for the smile. 

    In America, researchers talk about the 'contact smile.' You smile when you meet someone, before you even say something. So, if you understand that, that there is a different reason for the smile, then I think you can avoid this misinterpretation of the situation.

    Track 2:
    6:11 Dr Laurent Borgmann: There is one other thing where I take Americans to the side and explain something to them. This is when they come over as visiting professors. Before I take them into my classrooms. Actually I warn them that my students will not smile at them, that they will be listening very attentively, and they will come up to me afterwards and say, 'Gosh, that was a really interesting lecture. Why don't we have lecturers like that over here?'
    Kyle Hickman: When I was here first, student exchange program, we put on a show for a bunch of German students.

    6:40 Kyle Hickman: And there's no smiles. And the clap. You could barely hear the clap. And really .. What's going on?
    
    I'm a person who loves to make eye contact and say, Hi to anyone on the street. And, coming here, it was a big cultural shock, And I mean I'll make the eye contact, still, but, uh, it's there's no smiles, so I feel like they either want to fight me, or they don't like me, or, but, uh, it is, I think a lot of it is cultural. And I don't know if it comes maybe from Great Britain. But, it is nice. 

    7:11 Kyle Hickman: It, it's validation. it just makes it more pleasant and friendly. So it is a very .. It's a cultural thing that I think Americans do like and enjoy.
    Dr Laurent Borgmann: Kyle is right. What Americans enjoy as nice, pleasant contact, for example, greeting people we do not know in the street and acknowledging their presence with a smile, can be seen as too intrusive or superficial in some European countries. I always notice this when I enter a lift, or in this case, an elevator in the United States, and people who I've never met before in my life greet me and smile at me.

    7:48 Dr Laurent Borgmann: While in Germany, you often really pretend you're alone in the lift and look at the floor or at the door. In England you can notice a similar phenomenon. When people get off the public bus, they sometimes say, Thank you, to the bus driver, whereas in Germany, the bus driver would remain totally anonymous, almost as if he or she was a part of the bus. I like this behavior and tried it out in Germany, but as you can imagine, the bus driver frowned and thought there was something very wrong with me.

    00:16 This feels pretty wierd, doesn't it. It's like I'm breaking some unwritten rule, right? Well, psychologists would say I'm breaking about two or three at once.
    Too much staring, too little personal space. Put them together and suddenly something's got to give. You've got to break eye contact, or get away.
    It's actually called the Elevator Effect. Funny thing is, it's not confined to elevators. It happens in all sorts of places. Even in a place where almost all the other unwritten rules don't apply.

    01:35 Rosenfeld: Where are we right now, Nick?
    Yi: This is just an a, location in Second Life for, you know, people usually gather. So all these people are milling about. It's a pretty normal crowd.
    Voice-over: I quickly found out that what's normal in Second Life, isn't necessarily what's normal in real life.
    Rosenfeld: Behind us looks like there's almost some sort of rabbit.
    Voice-over: But there was some pretty important similarities too.
    Yi: You look across a scene in general. People are pretty spread out. They try to maintain a decent amount of personal space.

    02:54 Yi: In real life, both personal distance and eye gaze are ways of expressing intimacy.
    inaudible Right now, when we're both looking at each other like right then, that feels a way too intimate for the situation right now, you know?
    Rosenfeld: Okay, I'll back off. I can take a hint.
    Voice-over: Nick measured eye contact at Second Life by examining the degree to which people faced each other. The smaller the angle, the more eye contact.
    I figured the best way to see what Nick means is by starting an impromptu staring contest. This bald fellow seemed like a good enough candidate.

   03:45 Yi: There was another final thing that was the most interesting one. It's called the Elevator Effect. 
   So what that Elevator Effect says is that you need to balance personal distance with eye contact.
   Voice-over: So, in other words, says Rules One and Two are related. They can balance each other out. If someone is standing too close to you, looking away makes it feel less weird. And when someone is staring right at you, stepping back breaks the tension.
   Just like in real life, the best way to see this unwritten rule in action is to break it.

    8:30 Craig: And, um, we had to, um, go away for a week and come back on a bit of a visa run. And when we came back, we spent another two and a half, three months there. And I found that time really difficult. Now it was weird, because we had a bit of a support network by then. We had made some friends. We had met some really lovely people. Um, We knew our colleagues quite well. And you know, you expect with that kind of stuff, with the extra people and knowing your way around, that life would be better. But I was going through the difficulty of this negotiation phase.

    I didn't want to go home. It wasn't homesickness. It was just this kind of, I don't know, angry depression. Kind of emotionally tired from butting your head up against difference all the time.

    Chinese have many ways of saying No without saying No.
    
    One of the, most important, or most common ways, the Chinese say No, without saying No, is they use objections as a way of communicating disagreement.
    
    What is an objection? An objection is a request for more information, before you can make a decision.
    
    So the Westerner says, 'Hey, I think we should do X.' Mr Chen now, gives an objection to doing X, 'Oh, X will cost a lot of money.'
    
    Well, Mr Smith now goes, 'Well, yeh, yeh, yeh. It'll cost a lot of money.' But that, he now satisfies that objection.
    
    And now back to Chen. Now if Chen is silent or changes the subject to another objection, it means now he is satisfied with the first objection, and that now he moves to another one: 'Well, it'll be disruptive.'
    
    Mr Smith goes, 'Well, yeh, it'll be disruptive. But you're a good manager. You'll be able to solve that.' In Smith's mind, when Chen doesn't answer, that means agreement. To Chen, he thinks, he's clearly communicated doing X is 'a bad idea. We shouldn't do it.'
    
    When Mr Smith now doesn't go, 'Okay, we are now doing X,' (because he doesn't feel he has to. It's already been communicated), he walks away, thinking, 'Good. We're going to do X. Mr Chen's on board.' Mr Chen walks away, thinking, 'Good, I've explained why we can't do X. Now we have to find another way to do it.'
    
    This happens all the time in Asia. It's because of different rules of communication. The rule that I believe Westerners should know is, Two objections means disagreement. 
    
    Actually, there's a, a, bigger rule. Anything other than Yes, means No.

    2:05 Lu: Now in regard to today's topic, I wanted to pick your brain a bit more about what you mean by that, when you said there are three types of Westerners doing business in China. Can you give us an overview on what you mean?
    Bissky: Sure. The good the bad and ugly. Let me start with ugly. Um, and this is the all-too-common haters. One way of doing business in the world. And you Buy Low, Sell High. I want the Chinese to do it my way, because my way is the right way. And, but, as I say, you see this very often. This is the Chinese stereotype of a Westerner. You know, all the reasons that the Chinese will work with Mr Ugly are bad. They'll work with Mr Ugly because they've got no other choice. They'll work with Mr Ugly because they're making obscene amounts of profit and that they'll never give to Mr Ugly. And the third reason is that they have no intention of following through on the deal and so they're just working with hustling with Mr Ugly until they just get a chance to get what they want and then they'll drop them.  And so this is Mr Ugly. And he looks at the entire situation through Western glasses.

    Lu: Right. And a person like Mr Ugly doesn't often change that, does he.

    Bissky: No, no. Um, and that says, you know, they have no cultural sensitivity. They think that capitalism is capitalism. Business is business. And it's done the same all over the world. And that frequently these are people who don't have much or any international experience. But that's not always. I've talked with people who've got lots of experience but they've been the bull in the china shop in every culture they've been to.

    Lu: So basically it's not China-specific. It's just that these are the type of businessmen or women, when they go overseas, they like to throw their weight around, I would say.

    Bissky: Exactly. Often, it's the Type A executive, the executive that's been groomed for greater things in the multi-national. And that now they need some international experience, so they get shifted to Shanghai for nine months and that now they want to make their mark when they're in Shanghai. And they're not paying attention to the Chinese realities. They're asking the Chinese to adapt to them.

    Lu: You know what is interesting is that kind of personality, though, often works for them here in the US, doesn't it.
    Bissky: Without a doubt.

  - U.S. Immigration Law -- How to Report an Illegal Immigrant
  - intercultural

    Some new people have moved into your neighborhood. And they're different than you. They don't seem to talk English. They seem to do different things and you are suspicious of whether or not they're illegal immigrants. And you want to report them as illegal immigrants.

    I'm Robert Todd and I'm here to answer the question, how to report an illegal immigrant. Well, first of all, just because someone doesn't speak English doesn't make them an illegal immigrant. Be sure that your suspicion is more on their appearance of hiding, or being evasive, than the fact that they don't speak the same language as you.

    But if you're sure that you have a reasonable belief that they're illegal immigrants, call the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This can be found in the Yellow Pages or on the Internet. They have a 1-800 number. 

    After you've reported them, be sure that you insist on your anonymity. You don't want to give your name and address, and so forth. But let the federal employees of this agency do their job. You've reported them. That's all you're asked to do as a good citizen. Let them do their job.

    But finally, remember. Don't discriminate against others simply because they speak a little differently than you, or because they have a different culture or a different creed. That's what makes this country great.

    I'm Robert Todd, and thank you for watching.

    Theresa: Many times when I look back on your upbringing, if I had to do it again, a couple of things I would have changed,
    Stephanie: What would you do differently?
    Theresa: I would be a little more compromising. Remember some boy gave you a necklace?
    Stephanie: And you made me go back to school the next day and give him back the locket.
    Theresa: Okay, I was taught from my mom, do not accept presents from strangers, because if you accept presents from them, you have to repay them; it's a debt you have to carry to your grave. So things like that, I'd go back and be a little more understanding. I might ask to go swap it out for something cheaper.
    Most of your friends are Vietnamese too, right? And, um, I don't know if you ever compare, if your mommy is tougher than mine?
    Stephanie: I don't even know where to start with that. Oh, when you're 12 and your whole world revolves around who got to sleep over at whoever's house, it's not fun to say, 'Oh no, I can't do that.' 
    Theresa: I know, a lot of times I am living in this country trying to acculturate--but at the same time, I want to preserve the Asian culture. I want to keep the family together, And sometimes when I look back I ... I do realize that I was a little bit too tough.
    Stephanie: I wouldn't say that I resent you in any way for that. I think I learned a very strong sense of right and wrong, and working hard.
    Theresa: I know many, many times I'm very proud of you-- but I just don't say it. And Daddy gets on my case all the time: 'You don't say it, you don't say it,' and I would tell him, 'But she knows I feel it.' I don't know if you do know or not,
    Stephanie: I'm glad that you're proud of me, because most of the time I feel like I'm a disappointment.
    Theresa: No, you are not! I am just one of those old Asian moms. We never say we love you--we expect you to see it through our actions. But I'm learning, I'm learning. When I go away from this life, I want you to remember my love for you, that's all. I don't care for anything else.

And I was talking to him about, uh, uh, this kind of thing. And, uh, after a while, he said to me, 'You'll be wanting to leave now. You'll be wanting to leave.'

    So I didn't know what he was trying to do. Uh. So, let's look at the savoirs. Savoir 1. Uh, it was interesting to me, what he was doing here. Uh, uh, I was curious about the Aboriginal culture, and, uh .. Was he curious about me.

    They wouldn't say, 'Please leave.' They wouldn't really say, 'You'll be wanting to leave now,' either. It's very difficult for them to do that, I think.

    Savoir 4. I wasn't able to use what I knew. I wasn't able to use my ability in English to ask a good question to find out what he really wanted. Uh, I could've said, 'Do I look tired?' or something. And, uh, I wasn't able to do that. And so, I didn't really have Savoir 4.

    And, and I also asked, asked them, Would you like to learn Hakka with me? But they didn't. They didn't want to learn Hakka with me. They say... They told me to learn Hakka for them is useless. But I think to learn a new language is interesting. But they didn't want to learn it.

    And I think they didn't want to learn Hakka with me is because they were afraid that I would laugh at them, just like they laughed at me.

    One time, together with my parents-in-law, I went out to buy something. Because my mother-in-law wanted to cook something, but we need the material. So, I drive my car, pick up my father-in-law. go to the market. Then we buy something. And, ten minutes later, we finish the shopping. Then I go to the counter, I want to pay the money. But my father-in-law say, Oh, it's okay, it's okay. I can pay.
    But in the Hakka community, actually it is the son or the junior who should pay because we are family. But in the Minnan, I don't know. But I want to show I'm the good son. So I like to quickly pay, don't care. My father-in-law, later, we went back to the car, my father made a long face. Because I really didn't understand why he made the long face.
    And later, we come home, then I talk to my wife. My wife say in the Minnan culture, I am the guest. And basically, we buy something, in the family. Because the family is cooking something to treat the guest, everybody should follow the master, the host, the ruler. Even buying something, it's okay. The host can pay, If it's just like you're fighting or arguing with the host.
    You will make the host feel unhappy: "And since I'm poor, I cannot afford to pay?" So, then I understand. Oh, yes. Sorry. Because I'm really not knowledgeable about the Minnan culture. Because after all, I'm just a Hakka person. In the Hakka community, it's no problem. Even the son-in-law, or the daughter-in-law. It's okay. They pay the money, buy something. It's reasonable for them. So that's it. Another event.

    (Giggle) Okay, um. When I was uh, eighteen, I remember my grandmother invited me to a party. And in Miaoli, I think. Um, because I lived in Hsinchu all the time. So I think it's the first time I go to a party in Miaoli in a Hakka village. So they doesn't know, they don't know I am Hakka. I can speak Hakka. So they say some bad things about a woman who I know, who is my friend. So they talk a lot, the bad words and say, Oh, she's not very good. She has a lot of girl, boy friends. Some, you know, private things. Not good. And I think, Oh, my god, what do I have to say?

    And I just try, I want, I really want to pretend that I don't know, but I have to say hello to my friend's mother. So I say, I use Hakka and say, Hi, Aunty, And suddenly, Oh, my god, they are very shocked. It's a big shock to them, I think.

Because they think most of the people don't know Hakka. So they will try to pretend, Oh, they are talking and talking, but actually they are saying bad things, maybe someone. Yes.

    Hello, You. Some things get on my fucking nerves. It gets on my nerves. And to me. You know I always talk to my mother about these things. I mean I know they can be random. But, nonetheless, they are issues. You know what I'm saying? They're issues. Talking about these things. You know honey, everyone can't be you. Everyone is not going to view it the way you do. And that's true. But some things are like common knowledge. Common courtesies. Common sense. You know what I'm saying? So, one thing I'm like is, you know, if you own a place of business. Let's just say, you own an African hair braiding salon. Or you own a cosmetic .. You know what I'm saying? Like those little corner store often run by Korean or Chinese whatever. They sell like the hair weaves all that thing. Or even if you go into a Mexican restaurant where it's really run by Mexicans, whatever the case may be.

    One thing I don't like is .. I'm all for being bilingual. I'm all for bilingual. I love it. I think it's great to speak English and another language. 

    ...

    The problem I have is, I don't like it when I go into a place where it's a person, or a group of people who are bilingual who work there, and who are bilingual. And they'll be speaking English before they see me. No sooner than those motherfuckers lay eyes on me, okay? this is too good to be true. No, bitch. You can take your eyes off me, sweetheart. You're not Lauryn Hill. You're not Lauryn. Get off it, okay.

    So, I hate when they see me all of a sudden they go back to their native language.

  - "Andrew upset by Hakka couple speaking Hakka"
  - intercultural
  - all
  - |+
    Monica: Andrew mentioned that he rented a house and the hosts were a Hakka couple. They talked about the rent in Hakka. Andrew wondered, Why did they do that? Why didn't they talk in Chinese. They confused him.

    Under those conditions, if I were Andrew, I would agree with him. They are hosts. They can't use Hakka in front of a customer. It's impolite. I will think they are talking about something secret and want to raise the rent.
    
    But on the other hand, if I am the host, I will ask, Why should I not speak in Hakka. I am a Hakka. I think that is my right. You can't forbid me. Even if we are talking about raising the rent, or saying some bad things about you, it's none of your business. 
    
    Evaluating Andrew's attitude to the incident, Andrew did not think about why they should speak Hakka. They are Hakka.  They always talk to each other in Hakka, so it's not strange that they do that. If you are a Taiwanese, you will use Taiwanese to talk to people who speak Taiwanese, right? It's normal for Taiwanese to speak Taiwanese and Hakka to speak Hakka.  So, the host probably was not aware that Andrew was wondering why they were talking to each other in Hakka.
    
    I am a Hakka too. I usually speak Hakka with my family.  Because we are used to speaking in Hakka. It's our communication style. But I also usually speak Chinese with my friends who are Hakka too. It's natural that we do that.  
    I think Taiwanese will do the same. I have some friends who are Taiwanese. The also use Taiwanese with their families, and Chinese with friends. I asked my friends, Why don't you talk with your friends in Taiwanese. They said, No reason, it's just natural to use Chinese. All of us will sometimes use our mother tongue with each other. But it's not frequent. It's used for effect.


    
    Dr Bean: Andrew, a student, came to Miaoli. And he rented a house from a Hakka couple. And they were talking about the rent in Hakka in front of him. And Andrew was unhappy that they were talking about the rent, they were talking in Hakka and he didn't understand what they were saying.

    Now I had an, a, student called Monica. And Monica was a Hakka student. And she wrote an essay about this story a couple of years ago in the, uh, in this class. And she said, If I were An.., If I were Andrew, I would agree with Andrew. They are the hosts. They can't use Hakka in front of a customer. It's impolite. I'll think they are talking about something secret. They want to raise the rent. 
    
    On the other hand, if I'm the host, I'll think, Why can't I speak in Hakka. I'm a Hakka. It's, I think it's my right. You can't forbid me to speak Hakka. Even if we're talking about raising the rent. Or even if we're saying something bad about you, it's none of your business.

    Now, looking at Andrew's point of view, uh, we can criticize Andrew for not thinking, not, not thinking about why they can't speak in Hakka. Uh, they're Hakka. They always talk to each other in Hakka. So, it's not strange for them to speak Hakka to each other. If you're Taiwanese, you use Taiwanese with people who speak Taiwanese, okay? It's normal for Taiwanese to speak Taiwanese and for Hakka to speak Hakka.

    Uh, on the other hand, we can criticize the host for not thinking about what Andrew's feeling when they're talking Hakka in front of him. Uh, they should've been polite. They should've spoken, uh, Mandarin. in front of Andrew, not Hakka, which is like a secret, or a private, language.

    I really enjoyed this essay by, uh, Monica. because she was able to criticize both people, both, both sides, both parties. Andrew and the Hakka couple. Uh. She was, and she was able to agree with both of them. She was able to agree with both the, uh, with both the Hakka couple and with Andrew. So we can see that there's, it's very complicated, it's very complex. There are good things about, uh, what both people were thinking. And there are also bad things about what both people, what both sides were thinking.

    This is, this is very interesting, I think.

    Do I have the 5 savoirs? I am going to evaluate myself. I will give myself a grade out of 5 points for each of the 5 savoirs. I am talking about communication with Taiwanese people.
    
    Savoir 1: Interest and a lack of ethnocentrism. 2 out of 5 points. I am open not ethnocentric. But I am here in Taiwan and I am not going out to find out more about Taiwanese culture. I am not really very interested, I think.
    
    Savoir 2: Knowledge of Taiwanese culture and ways of social interaction. 2 out of 5 points. I am in Taiwan but I don't get together with Taiwanese people much outside school. I have some ideas about how they relate to each other, but I don't really have much knowledge of the ways they relate to each other.
    
    Savoir 3: Ability to interpret strange Taiwanese customs in terms of familiar customs. 5 out of 5 points. I think I am very good at seeing relationships between the strange and familiar. Everyone is all the same. Cultural differences are all relative. Taiwanese don't smile at or greet strangers, but this is the same as privacy in the West.
    
    Savoir 4: Skill at using what you know in real communication and learning more about the culture. 3 out of 5 points. I am not good at it. I know Taiwanese students don't feel they have to greet me, but I still feel bad when they don't do greet me. I don't know how to get them to greet me.
    
    Savoir 5: Critical cultural awareness. 4 out of 5 points. I am very critical of Western culture. I know Westerners think they are being very friendly by smiling, but I know it is not real friendliness. I am also critical of Taiwanese people, with their lack of concern for the feelings of the other person.

    This class is also an example of intercultural communication. You are Taiwanese. I am a Westerner.
    
    We come from two different cultures, and we are talking to each other.
    
    The issue I want to talk about is your use of Chinese as a private language, and my non-use of Chinese.
    
    I want to think about it the way Monica wrote about Andrew and his Hakka landlords.
    
    Is it right for you to use Chinese to speak to each other? How is it right and how is it wrong? How is it right and how is wrong from your viewpoint and from my viewpoint?
    
    I don't think it is right for you to use Chinese with each other. I think you SHOULD use English to speak to each other in the classroom, even though you use Chinese outside the classroom. Of COURSE you should Chinese with each other outside the classroom. But I think you should just use English IN the classroom.
    
    On the other hand, it IS perfectly right for you to use Chinese with each other in the classroom. The teacher can't forbid students to use their native language. The teacher can't forbid students using a language that he or she doesn't understand. In this intercultural communication class, the students need to talk about their experiences and ideas. They can't do this in English. They have to use Chinese. They SHOULD use Chinese.
    
    But, you are also using Chinese to talk about things which are not related to the class. For example, you are talking about homework in other classes, or about events in your daily lives. You SHOULDN'T do this. The private language you are using is often used for unimportant reasons, not for the important one of learning about intercultural communication. You should try hard to use English, the language you are studying, to communicate with each other.
    
    On the other hand, Dr Bean should make more effort to learn Chinese and accept what is natural for his students. I need to be better at putting myself in your position and seeing things from your viewpoint. I need to learn more. When I have more Savoir 1, 2 and 4, I will agree you SHOULD use Chinese to speak to each other. If I used more Chinese in the class, I might be able to do this.

    Toni Cook: Well, let me first indicate that we, as the School Board, never made a decision about Ebonics. What we said was, in the resolution, was that our children come to us speaking a language which is non-standard English. Some may call it Ebonics, as was coined by Dr Williams. Others may call it African language patterns. Some may call it Pan-African systems. Our goal was to move the young people from where they are to bridge the gap and take them to where we want them to be and that was readers, writers and speakers of standard American competitive English. Ours was a literacy goal.
    Steve Harvey: I tell you one thing. If you do have a dictionary, it'd better be in pencil. You know, like the word, Hello. How're you going to put the word, Hello in an Ebonics dictionary. You know how many ways we got to say, Hello? It'd take up five, six pages. Hey, na! What up? Lookee here. [unintelligible] And what about the one that ain't a word at all. How about this here, hello. 
    But I'm going to tell you the real reason that America is rushing to come up with an Ebonics dictionary. This is the real reason. And listen to me close.

And you know, there were 347 drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the year 2005. I think this may be the first drunk driving story we've done from Virginia. And the only reason it's news on "The Factor" is because the driver was an illegal alien. What if his name was Bubba? What if his name was Buddy? What if his name was Bobby?
