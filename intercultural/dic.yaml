    6:11 Dr Laurent Borgmann: There is one other thing where I take Americans to the side and explain something to them. This is when they come over as visiting professors. Before I take them into my classrooms. Actually I warn them that my students will not smile at them, that they will be listening very attentively, and they will come up to me afterwards and say, 'Gosh, that was a really interesting lecture. Why don't we have lecturers like that over here?'
    Kyle Hickman: When I was here first, student exchange program, we put on a show for a bunch of German students.

    6:40 Kyle Hickman: And there's no smiles. And the clap. You could barely hear the clap. And really .. What's going on?
    
    I'm a person who loves to make eye contact and say, Hi to anyone on the street. And, coming here, it was a big cultural shock, And I mean I'll make the eye contact, still, but, uh, it's there's no smiles, so I feel like they either want to fight me, or they don't like me, or, but, uh, it is, I think a lot of it is cultural. And I don't know if it comes maybe from Great Britain. But, it is nice.

    Dr Laurent Borgmann: Kyle is right. What Americans enjoy as nice, pleasant contact, for example, greeting people we do not know in the street and acknowledging their presence with a smile, can be seen as too intrusive or superficial in some European countries. I always notice this when I enter a lift, or in this case, an elevator in the United States, and people who I've never met before in my life greet me and smile at me.

    7:48 Dr Laurent Borgmann: While in Germany, you often really pretend you're alone in the lift and look at the floor or at the door. In England you can notice a similar phenomenon. When people get off the public bus, they sometimes say, Thank you, to the bus driver, whereas in Germany, the bus driver would remain totally anonymous, almost as if he or she was a part of the bus. I like this behavior and tried it out in Germany, but as you can imagine, the bus driver frowned and thought there was something very wrong with me.

    00:16 This feels pretty wierd, doesn't it. It's like I'm breaking some unwritten rule, right? Well, psychologists would say I'm breaking about two or three at once.
    Too much staring, too little personal space. Put them together and suddenly something's got to give. You've got to break eye contact, or get away.
    It's actually called the Elevator Effect. Funny thing is, it's not confined to elevators. It happens in all sorts of places. Even in a place where almost all the other unwritten rules don't apply.

    Yi: This is just an a, location in Second Life for, you know, people usually gather. So all these people are milling about. It's a pretty normal crowd.
    Voice-over: I quickly found out that what's normal in Second Life, isn't necessarily what's normal in real life.
    Rosenfeld: Behind us looks like there's almost some sort of rabbit.
    Voice-over: But there was some pretty important similarities too.
    Yi: You look across a scene in general. People are pretty spread out. They try to maintain a decent amount of personal space.

    02:54 Yi: In real life, both personal distance and eye gaze are ways of expressing intimacy.
    inaudible Right now, when we're both looking at each other like right then, that feels a way too intimate for the situation right now, you know?
    Rosenfeld: Okay, I'll back off. I can take a hint.
    Voice-over: Nick measured eye contact at Second Life by examining the degree to which people faced each other. The smaller the angle, the more eye contact.
    I figured the best way to see what Nick means is by starting an impromptu staring contest. This bald fellow seemed like a good enough candidate.

   03:45 Yi: There was another final thing that was the most interesting one. It's called the Elevator Effect. 
   So what that Elevator Effect says is that you need to balance personal distance with eye contact.
   Voice-over: So, in other words, says Rules One and Two are related. They can balance each other out. If someone is standing too close to you, looking away makes it feel less weird. And when someone is staring right at you, stepping back breaks the tension.
   Just like in real life, the best way to see this unwritten rule in action is to break it.

    8:30 Craig: And, um, we had to, um, go away for a week and come back on a bit of a visa run. And when we came back, we spent another two and a half, three months there. And I found that time really difficult. Now it was weird, because we had a bit of a support network by then. We had made some friends. We had met some really lovely people. Um, We knew our colleagues quite well. And you know, you expect with that kind of stuff, with the extra people and knowing your way around, that life would be better. But I was going through the difficulty of this negotiation phase.

    I didn't want to go home. It wasn't homesickness. It was just this kind of, I don't know, angry depression. Kind of emotionally tired from butting your head up against difference all the time.

    2:05 Lu: Now in regard to today's topic, I wanted to pick your brain a bit more about what you mean by that, when you said there are three types of Westerners doing business in China. Can you give us an overview on what you mean?
    Bissky: Sure. The good the bad and ugly. Let me start with ugly. Um, and this is the all-too-common haters. One way of doing business in the world. And you Buy Low, Sell High. I want the Chinese to do it my way, because my way is the right way. And, but, as I say, you see this very often. This is the Chinese stereotype of a Westerner. You know, all the reasons that the Chinese will work with Mr Ugly are bad. They'll work with Mr Ugly because they've got no other choice. They'll work with Mr Ugly because they're making obscene amounts of profit and that they'll never give to Mr Ugly. And the third reason is that they have no intention of following through on the deal and so they're just working with hustling with Mr Ugly until they just get a chance to get what they want and then they'll drop them.  And so this is Mr Ugly. And he looks at the entire situation through Western glasses.

    Lu: Right. And a person like Mr Ugly doesn't often change that, does he.

    Bissky: No, no. Um, and that says, you know, they have no cultural sensitivity. They think that capitalism is capitalism. Business is business. And it's done the same all over the world. And that frequently these are people who don't have much or any international experience. But that's not always. I've talked with people who've got lots of experience but they've been the bull in the china shop in every culture they've been to.

    Lu: So basically it's not China-specific. It's just that these are the type of businessmen or women, when they go overseas, they like to throw their weight around, I would say.

    Bissky: Exactly. Often, it's the Type A executive, the executive that's been groomed for greater things in the multi-national. And that now they need some international experience, so they get shifted to Shanghai for nine months and that now they want to make their mark when they're in Shanghai. And they're not paying attention to the Chinese realities. They're asking the Chinese to adapt to them.

    Lu: You know what is interesting is that kind of personality, though, often works for them here in the US, doesn't it.
    Bissky: Without a doubt.

  - U.S. Immigration Law -- How to Report an Illegal Immigrant
  - intercultural
  - all
  - |+
    Some new people have moved into your neighborhood. And they're different than you. They don't seem to talk English. They seem to do different things and you are suspicious of whether or not they're illegal immigrants. And you want to report them as illegal immigrants.

    I'm Robert Todd and I'm here to answer the question, how to report an illegal immigrant. Well, first of all, just because someone doesn't speak English doesn't make them an illegal immigrant. Be sure that your suspicion is more on their appearance of hiding, or being evasive, than the fact that they don't speak the same language as you.

    But if you're sure that you have a reasonable belief that they're illegal immigrants, call the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This can be found in the Yellow Pages or on the Internet. They have a 1-800 number. 

    After you've reported them, be sure that you insist on your anonymity. You don't want to give your name and address, and so forth. But let the federal employees of this agency do their job. You've reported them. That's all you're asked to do as a good citizen. Let them do their job.

    But finally, remember. Don't discriminate against others simply because they speak a little differently than you, or because they have a different culture or a different creed. That's what makes this country great.

    I'm Robert Todd, and thank you for watching.

    One has to avoid over-generalization, but there's a frequently-experienced difference between the USA and Germany, as to when people smile.

    Researchers say that actually there's a different attitude to smiling. Let's just look at what smiling really means in those two countries.

    I think in Germany, people smile for a reason. And they often say about the Americans, Ah, people smile all the time. This is superficial. This is actually insincere, or maybe even dishonest.

    And if you talk to Americans about Germans, they can often say, Ah, the Germans are really unfriendly. When I go in the service encounter, a shop or I'm doing business, they never seem to smile.

    Now, what's the reason for this? I think in Germany, the smile is something reserved for a particular occasion, or has a particular cause. There is a reason for the smile.

    In America, researchers talk about the 'contact smile.' You smile when you meet someone, before you even say something. So, if you understand that, that there is a different reason for the smile, then I think you can avoid this misinterpretation of the situation.
