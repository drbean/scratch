We will do 2 role plays. One is the planned role play of a discussion by
Fonterra and Sanlu directors. Show how both sides were not good communicators.

We will do another unplanned role play. This is a role play of the meetings by
Fonterra officials and Shijiazhuang health officials.

"When Fonterra was informed, it held three meetings to try to persuade
Shijiazhuang health officials to raise the alarm without success, The Daily
Telegraph has learned. 

"The central government had issued warnings about suppressing "bad news",
particularly about health scares, during the Olympics period," the Daily
Telegraph article said.

Try to show, hoewever, why poor intercultural communication might have been the
real cause of the failure of Fonterra to get the Chinese government to recall
the bad milk.

And produce a commentary on the role play, showing the intercultural
competences that the two sides DON'T show.
