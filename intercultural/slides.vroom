Intercultural communication

by Dr Bean

----
== Aim of the class

I want you to show me you are good intercultural
communicators.

----
== What is intercultural communication?

It's not how well you speak English.

You can speak Chinese and communicate with people from
somewhere else.

It's not about how to speak.
It's about what to say.


----
== Experience

Communicating with someone from a different culture
is very interesting.

You have to forget the rules you learned to communicate
and learn new rules.

----
== Examples of intercultural relationships

+ Taiwanese-American
+ Taiwanese-Japanese
+ Taiwanese-mainland Chinese
+ Han-aboriginal
+ Hakka-Minnan
+ 本生-外生
+ Male-Female
+ Taiwanese-Guest worker from Thailand, Philippines
+ Taiwanese-Guest worker from US, England

----
== Grades

+* Homework. Each week write a 50 word message on

== Ugly American accosts woman in Saigon (Ho Chi Min 
City), Vietnam

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKXbDXmzwnk

----
== Unacceptable

      I think that men's behavior is rude. I do 
      not like the ugly American. 
      
      I think most Americans feel shame and anger 
      at this video. 

----
== Understandable

      Americans are usually friendly. So they 
      accost the woman.

      They think maybe it is not polite but 
      their meaning is not bad!

----
== Discussion of Ugly American

In groups, decide whether you support 
'Unacceptable' or 'Understandable'

Think about Double Standards.
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=double+standards

Think about the 5 savoirs. Slide 8 of 
http://www.international-studies.aau.dk/f-2007/slides/ICC-model.ppt

Report on what your group talked about. Vote for 
what you think. Vote for what Americans think.

The groups which report most get most points.

----
== Cross-cultural understanding and Intercultural 
understanding

Cross-cultural: about cultural differences and
		similarities

Intercultural: about communication between people 
		from different cultures

----
== Cross-cultural

Cross-cultural:	eg, In the US, people act this way, 
		say these things.
		On the other hand, in Vietnam,
		people act that way and
		say those things.

		ie, cultural differences
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love

----
== Intercultural

Intercultural:	eg, Vietnamese-Americans communicate
		with their children across 
		cultural barriers.
		Vietnamese and Americans have a
		hard time understanding each 
		other, because of cultural 
		differences.

		ie communication between people 
		from different cultures

----
== Test: Which message is intercultural,
		which is cross-cultural?

A: Theresa is like the mothers in Asian that can't 
   say love easily but she expresse her love to her 
   daughter with actions although culture is 
   difference between the Vietnam and the United 
   States the mothers' love to their kids are all the 
   same Just sometimes they don't know how to express 
   their love in oral

B: In my opinion, this mom has the very big 
   courage.Because living the different culture in 
   America and she must upbringing little girl.But 
   she must to keep Asian tradition,keep the family 
   together.In her pressure,Stephanie worry about she 
   not too well.In fact,they love each other.It's 
   wonderful.

    savoirs.

Not the usual sort of writing exam. It's OK to 
talk to each other, look at each other's 
essays, and use your computers. In fact I will

----
== An intercultural experience

A representative from each group will stand up
and tell a story about an intercultural meeting.

Who showed which of the 5 savoirs?

----
== Ugly Americans accost Vietnamese woman

The woman and I grew up in the same sort of culture,
so I think she felt not good.

Each country has a different culture. Maybe the 
Americans were just showing their friendliness, 
but we couldn't understand it.

So I was angry with what he did to the woman.

----
== Ugly Americans accost Vietnamese woman

Maybe the Americans were just kidding. They were 
curious about the Asian woman, and wanted to 
accost an unfamiliar person for fun.

But Asian culture is very conservative. We 
don't feel they were kidding, and it made us feel 
so embarrassed.

But, maybe, next time, we can learn to bring more 
humor to our understanding of their behavior.

----
== German-American misunderstanding about smiling

Americans like smiling to express their 
friendliness, but this leads to misunderstanding 
in Germany, where most people are meticulous and 
sensible. It makes them feel weird.

In my opinion, Americans can explain why they are 
smiling when meeting. Perhaps one day, Germans 
will think these strange things aren't strange.

----
== German-American misunderstanding about smiling

Communication between 2 different cultures can be 
very exciting or very frustrating.

Take smiling for example. People smiling at you
at times when you don't expect them or want them to
smile at you can be unpleasant.

But try not to be too critical when unpleasantness 
occurs. With more understanding, things feel 
better.

----
== Asian Mom in US

An example of cultural communication which may be 
misunderstood in the US is the Asian mother taking 
a tough attitude to her daughter and trying to 
maintain Asian traditions and keep the family 
together.

She doesn't know how to express 'love.' Americans 
might feel discomfort with this.

But no matter where we are, we should respect, 
rather than reject, cultural behavior like this.

----
Hakka story 1

In holiday or festival ,I often visited every 
place  I was not once had gone.In the Taiwan 
southern part,people usually are  Hakka,one time a

embarrassing.

----

reunification, the bride's side introduced Hakkas

== Same story as last week

Each country has the different language and each 
area also has the different culture. Formerly had 
newly married couples ,the bride's side is Hakka 
peoples, but the groom's family was the Minnan 
person, at some peaceful reunification, the 
bride's side introduced Hakkas famous product to 
the groom's family” Mochi”Time, tells everybody 
the “Mochi” Hakka language to call " Guiba " , but 
after the groom's family has listened, thinks is 
very strange, and thought that does not receive 
respects. However causes both sides to 
misunderstand, this is the culture is different, 
the language different creates difference.

----
Savoirs

    About Hakka story:

In my opinion,the writer use the savior 2.

The writer doesn't understand what the man ask but 
he/she still answer him.
That's the reason why they laugh the writer.
SO I think it's about knowledgeable and 
cross-cultural differences.

----

Savoir 1:Interested and curious:
Savoir 3:Understanding:
Savoir 4:Asking the right questions:

Judgemental:

the way they had laughed at the writer's.

right to speak Hakka."

Remember Eunice was critical of the Hakka
people using Hakka to say bad things about
one of her friends.

"So they say some bad things about a 
woman who I know, who is my friend."

Classroom language

Should the teacher use the national, standard language, or
the language the students speak?

  Black teacher says teachers should not use Black English
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhAiTuTI8Vs

  In California, Chinese-American students were taught in
Chinese. The schools didn't want it. Activists did want it.
On San Francisco Government TV http://www.sfgovtv.org

http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=cXhQrJ37gFE

This was the start of bilingual education in the US.
This is not the same as 'bilingual kindergartens'
in Taiwan.

----
Should teachers use the language of their students, 
or the national, standard language, to teach?

In the US, eg Chinese, Spanish (or Ebonics, ie Black English)
For Black English vocabulary see http://urbandictionary.com

----
Should teachers use Hakka or Minnan to teach in Taiwan?
Dr Bean wants to know.

Or should they use Mandarin? Or Vietnamese (for the children
of Vietnamese mothers)?

----
Should teachers use the language of their students, 
or the national, standard language, to teach?


Try to take a balanced position. Express both points
of view
Use the words, 'but,' 'although,' 'On the other hand,'
Disagree with partners.
Say, What do you think?
