5 3-line conversations between A and B, where one person or both are bad
intercultural communicators. That is, they:

a: are ethnocentric, or
b: they don't know very much about the other culture and its rules of
communication, or
c: they can't interpret the events in terms of their own culture, or
d: they aren't able to apply what they have learned in real communication, or
e: they aren't critical of their own culture, or of the other culture.

These 5 intercompetences are in the Intercultural competence item.

See http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/Guide_dimintercult_EN.pdf
See p73 on the textbook for a discussion of ethnocentrism.

What I want:

1.

A (American customer): Smiles (on meeting B, in a store)
B (German storeperson): Looks unhappy. (Thinks: Why is A smiling at me? I don't
like it.)

This shows that A doesn't have much knowledge of American interpersonal
cultural rules, ie the contact smile, or is ethnocentric.  (savoir etre)

2.

A (North American woman, who has lived with Hispanics for many years): "Uh, uh,
excuse me." (Thinks: I can't get the people's attention, even though I know I
just have to speak.) 

This shows the American woman cannot put into practice knowledge that she has
(savoir faire/apprendre).
