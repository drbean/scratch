</p>

<p>
> How much time should we record as a sound file?

<p>
One minute. I expect EACH person will say something and there will be
some comments by the other members on what is said. That's 15
seconds (approximately) each.

<p>
I just want a conversation, but you must refer to Byram's five
types of intercultural communication competence and how the
communication experience didn't show these.

<p>
> When should we turn in the file?

<p>
I want you to upload it as a sound file to an FLA0027 album which
you will construct in the account of one of your members in Week
4, or in a new account, and be ready to talk about intercultural
communication competence in the class in Week 4.

<p>
> Is it before week 4 as our homework or in week 4 class as a test?

<p>
Both, but there is no writing involved. It is all talking and
listening.

<p>
There will probably be a homework dictation exercise in that week too.

<p>
> And
> also I don’t have the password for the site to upload my sound file.

<p>
If you or Ting'an or Hank, the other members in your group, don't
have a http://wretch.cc account, you will have to get one. It's
free.

<p>
Make a FLA0027 album in the
學園生活(學校、班級、社團、同學會、校友會) category.

<p> I want ONE soundfile in the FLA0027 album, not more. I want <ul>
<li>the 2 cultural
groups in the <b>name</b> of the sound file (eg Men refuse to listen to women, or
Taiwanese misunderstand Japanese) and 
<li>the names of the members of your class
group in English and their ID numbers in the <b>comments</b> to the soundfile.
</ul>

<p>
The sound of the file must be clear and understandable. The file
must be playable on my computer.

<p>
No fancy graphics or advanced functions.

Thank YOU!
