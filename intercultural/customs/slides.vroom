== XOXOXO: Hugs and kisses (Custom 17)

X = One kiss
O = One hug

People who couldn't sign their names would write a cross and
kiss the cross to show their feeling for what they were signing.

So X came to mean a kiss.

I'll tell her I need it to do my homework.

== Misunderstanding about American smiling

Communication between 2 different cultures can be 
very exciting or very frustrating.

Take smiling for example. Americans smile at you
at times when you don't expect them or want them to
smile at you. This can be unpleasant.

But try not to be too critical when unpleasantness 
occurs. With more understanding, things feel 
better.

----
== Asian Mom in US

An example of cultural communication which may be 
misunderstood in the US is the Asian mother taking 
a tough attitude to her daughter and trying to 
maintain Asian traditions and keep the family 
together.

She doesn't know how to express 'love.' Americans 
might feel discomfort with this.

But no matter where we are, we should respect, 
rather than reject, cultural behavior like this.

----
== Savoir 2: Cultural knowledge

Just as language knowledge is necessary to communicate
Savoir 2 (cultural knowledge) is also necessary

Language: linguistic knowlege (eg grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation)
 |
 |
 V
Culture: cultural knowledge (eg lifestyles, social interaction, material culture)

Ethnic groups in Belgium

http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Belgium&hl=en&ll=50.25423,5.119629&spn=4.552384,8.756104&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.879582,36.5625&vpsrc=6&hnear=Belgium&t=h&z=7

60 percent are Dutch speakers
40 percent are French speakers

60 percent of the Dutch speakers can speak French
20 percent of the French speakers can speak Dutch

----
Ethnocentrism

The Dutch community has been very helpful and generous
in teaching the French community how to do things the
right way.

----
Ethnocentrism

The Dutch community does many things backwards.


----
Ethnocentrism

The Belgian church (the Roman Catholic Church), that the
Dutch and French-speaking communities belonged to
traditionally, is the one true church.


----
Ethnocentrism in Belgium

French is a better language than Dutch for cultural activity.

----
Ethnocentrism in Belgium

The French-speaking community has to change their ways
and assimilate with the Belgian community.

----
Prejudices and stereotypes: the way of thinking of the ethnocentric 
	observer

Canadian Tourist: Look, that Taiwanese motorist is
throwing his cigarette butt out the window. (Thinks:
Taiwanese are litterers)

After returning home to Canada:
Ex-tourist: Hey, that man is dumping his trash in the river.
(Thinks: That man is a dirty man.)

----
== The intercultural observer

+ Stay a week in the foreign culture and
	be able to write an article.
+ Stay a year in the foreign culture and
	be able to write a book.
+ Stay 20 years in the foreign culture and
	not be able to say anything at all.

----
== Ideas about Americans, about Hakka

Americans are X.
Americans do X.
Hakka are X.
Hakka do Y.

----
These are generalizations, meaning

Most (All?) American are X.
Most (All?) Americans are X.
Most (All?) Americans do X.
Most (All?) Hakka are X.
Most (All?) Hakka do Y.

These may be stereotypes (a false generalization), if
they are based on insufficient evidence.  It is very
hard to prove a generalization is correct.

It is often easier to prove it is incorrect.

What kind of evidence is necessary to dis/prove a generalization?

Which of the 5 savoirs does someone with stereotypes of
the other group not have?

----
Dr Bean's generalizations about students in Korea
and Taiwan

Korean students are more interested in learning English
than Taiwanese students.

What kind of evidence would disprove that generalization?

----
== Prejudice

Prejudice is coming to conclusions about an affair without evidence

Sometimes coming to a conclusion without evidence is necessary.
Usually, however, the conclusions are based on stereotypes.

It is not good if stereotypes are used to come to a conclusion.
Every belief or conclusion has to be changeable.

Prejudice has come to mean a bad attitude to a different cultural
group.

----
== Are Americans/Taiwanese prejudiced?
Obama is president.
"I don't want Asians/Blacks/Hispanics living in my neighborhood."

Older Hakka woman: Minnan women make irascible (angry) brides.

----
== Discussion of sterotypes and prejudice

Beyond Language p 173

Don't be 3,4 books talking to each other.
(Dummies with a tape recorder)

Have a conversation.

Immigration in the US

----
Speaking a language other people don't understand

Many Americans are unhappy about the use of languages other than
English in the US.

See http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/privatelangue.html

----
Savoir 5 and people speaking a language a third party
doesn't understand

Being critical of both sides, but being able to see
both sides point of view.

Have an opinion.

----
== Foreigners speaking English in Japan

Some young foreign people met, some German,
some native English speakers, in Japan. One
of the people had a Japanese friend whose
English was not very good.  The Japanese
friend, the only Japanese person in the
room, felt uncomfortable with all the
foreigners, and only English being spoken.
The Japanese person's friend asked the young
foreigners to speak Japanese. 

Should the people speak Japanese or not?

----
== Why students feel they must speak Chinese

"We just speak Chinese to express what I want to say."
Is what you want to say worth saying? If it is not said,
what will be the loss?

+ Is what I am saying worth saying?

----
== The End
