In business, face-to-face contact with other people is very important, discussing things with people inside the company and meeting with people outside the company. For this reason, this course emphasizes spoken English.

Each week for homework, I will ask you to listen to a soundfile about some chapter in the textbook. Then in class I will ask you to talk to your partners about what you listened to.

Business people need to be able to discuss things in groups. So I am putting you into groups of four. Each of the four people in the group have different information, because they all listened to different soundfiles. They talk to each other to find out the information they don't have, but which they need, to understand the situation. This is difficult to do. It is difficult to understand what the other person is saying. It is difficult to put into words the things you want to say.

Discussion can be made easier if you have slides to show and to look at. So when we discuss things in groups, we will write down slides on A5 pieces of paper.

In class we will use the textbook, New Edition--Market Leader Pre-intermediate Business English. This is a good textbook. The topics are very important for people thinking about a business career. The exercises are good too. In class we will discuss the topics, listen to the CD, and do the exercises.

Exams will be a discussion in your groups of four of one of the topics covered in the weeks before.
