schooltrip:
  A: Thinking about your destination, you have to consider, how far it is from NUU. The further you travel, the more interesting, perhaps, but the longer it takes and the more it costs. Of course, you also need to consider what you want to do when you get there.
  B: Eating is very important, especially in Taiwan. You have to decide what kind of places you are going to eat at. Perhaps you will prepare your own food. You need to consider the atmosphere, the food itself, how far away from where you are, the prices, and the service (eg whether you have to wait a long time.)
  C: Where are you going to sleep? On the beach? Camping place? Hotel? One big room? Separate rooms? Youth hostel? How much are you willing to pay for accommodations? The more you pay, the more comfortable you will be. What might be okay for the men might not be okay for the women.
  D: What is the purpose of the trip? What are you going to do when you get there? Go swimming? Climb mountains? Eat? Play cards? Listen to speakers? Discuss school work? Hack? Why bother to go to this place if you can do all these things in NUU? What do you hope will be different in your lives after you return to NUU? Should you take people who are not your classmates?

    The Long Beach Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco is a five-star hotel on the beach, so it is very nice, but there is not much to do in the area around the hotel. 
    
    It has a lot of nice facilities, like a large swimming pool and a sauna, and a very large tropical garden where you can sit and eat and drink. It also has shops and a good nightclub where you can have fun in the evening.

    But there is not much you can do when you go outside the hotel. The town is one hour away by car. (The airport is the same distance away.) 

    There are two large conference rooms which both hold seventy people, but there are no smaller seminar rooms for smaller groups. This will be a big problem, because the conference participants will split up into smaller special interest groups to discuss things that are important for them.

    The cost of the venue works out at 1,500 dollars per participant. This includes all meals and entertainment at the night club and other places.

    Hotel Moda in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is a four-star hotel, but it is quite a lot cheaper than the other hotels and there are a lot of things to do and see in Prague.
    
   The hotel is a little older and smaller than the other hotels. But the bedroom are large and there is one conference room and two seminar rooms, so participants will be able to split up into three or more special interest groups.

   Other attractions include a large swimming pool (which is, however, open to the public), a sauna, a hairdressing salon and satellite TV.

   The price of 950 dollar per participant includes meals and two guided tours. Prague is a very interesting old city, so there is a lot to do in it. However the hotel is a half-hour subway ride away from the center of the city, and the hotel, and Prague, generally, is very crowded in summer.

    Hotel Matong, on Tiamon, an island off the east coast of Malaysia, is a five-star hotel with a relaxing atmosphere, but it is a long way to the nearest airport.

    It is quite a large hotel, so there are many large and small conference rooms. People can split up into many small special interest groups. It also has beautiful tropical gardens where you can sit and talk. There is also a golf course, tennis courts, and a soccer field.

    The cost of the venue is 1,350 dollars per participant, including meals. There is perhaps less to do than at the other three hotels, but this may be okay if the purpose of the conference is to discuss business problems.

    The beautiful island setting is peaceful and quiet, so participants may be able to get a lot done. The disadvantage is that it is a long way from the nearest airport. You have to ride a boat to get to the island.

    The Hotel Colossus is a big hotel in Las Vegas, in the U.S. It is the most expensive of the four hotels, but it has the most facilities.

    The five-star hotel looks magnificent and has very big bedrooms, outstanding conference rooms, and many smaller seminar rooms, which however cost extra.

    The price is 1,950 dollars, including meals, and one tour, and each participant gets fifty dollars spending money at the casino which is in the hotel, itself.

    Las Vegas is famous for casinos, but there are many other things that visitors can do in and around Las Vegas. The free use of a car to get to these places is included in the price.

    Of course, the casinos are the big attraction. This may be a disadvantage because the hotel is very, very busy, day and night. It may be difficult to keep tourists out of the conference area, and separate them from participants.

    The airport is close to Las Vegas, so this is one advantage of the venue.
