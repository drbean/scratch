Chinmin Institute of Technology is closing down its AFL
Department, and I am looking for another job. As a result of my
experiences here, I would be interested in teaching at a high
school. I wonder if you are interested in having me teach English
full time at your school. I think I would be an asset to your
English department.

</p>
<p>
For the eight years I have been in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been
working with lower-level, unmotivated students. Although it has
been a challenge teaching these students, it has been rewarding,
and even if I can&#39;t say I achieved a lot of the things I set out
to do with them, I believe I have developed a teaching style with
large classes that is innovative and effective.

</p>
<p>
One of the rewards for me has been the realization that I did an
excellent job creating favorable attitudes to English and
significantly increasing achievement. I seem to have gained my
students&#39; respect, perhaps because my teaching style, although
communicative, is supportive of all my students, both good and
bad.

</p>
<p>
But the problems of these students were unsolvable by me. This
has prompted me to think that perhaps if I intervened at an
earlier stage, in high school for example, I could do a better
job solving the problems, which I believe they share with all
students who learn English in the formal education system in
Taiwan.

</p>
<p>
These problems are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1. a lack of confidence that results from failure and other unenjoyable experiences in school that have damaged their self-esteem.</li>
<li>2. stress and other forms of discomfort which interfere with the learning process and which are the result of limited contact with English speakers.</li>
<li>3. a defensiveness about learning and an unwillingness to take risks with the language, the result of their experiments with the language being disappointing rather than rewarding.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this next step in my career, I look forward to becoming even
a better teacher by the continued development of my methods with
large classes and under difficult conditions. I am confident the
future is bright. I hope that your school also has such
views and is a forward-looking place to work. If it is, I would
enjoy working with you, developing confident, relaxed,
adventurous and superior speakers of the English language.
