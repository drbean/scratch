To Whom It May Concern,

</p>
<p>
When Sweety first asked me for a recommendation letter, I refused. She and      Stella hadn&#39;t stood out in the class. They didn&#39;t seem very interested in writing about their dreams or analyzing themselves. Sweety was a quiet student, never giving me any problems in the class, but she seemed diffident about approaching me. I don&#39;t think I ever talked to her more than once or twice except through Stella or another intermediary.

</p>
<p>
Despite this refusal, however, something must have been kindled in Sweety&#39;s     heart &#40;not of course of my doing&#41;, because her increased activity in writing for homework and on the web through the 6-8 weeks to the end of the semester    showed me that she could do the work at the same time as it convinced me that I could honestly recommend her to anyone unsure about whether to accept her or    not.

</p>
<p>
One particular essay about cooking for her family stood out. In an earlier essay, I had asked students to ask their friends questions about themselves. For example, am I beautiful? Or, what are my strong/weak points? In this essay, I wanted students to write about the shortcomings of something they had made or designed. She was the only one who got other people to critique the thing she had made. She very carefully described what her family thought of the meal and of ways it could be improved. I was very impressed by this essay, and realized that although in conversation she might not seem to have much basic communication skill or desire, in terms of cognitive-academic language proficiency, she was quite able. I hope she is able to continue to develop this proficiency, either academically, or in the workplace, in language, or perhaps even more fruitfully, as interpersonal action. On the basis of this essay, I hope, I am convinced that she has the ability to acquit herself honorably in    these and other activities she undertakes.

</p>
<p>
I heartily recommend Sweety Zhan.
Sincerely,



</p>
