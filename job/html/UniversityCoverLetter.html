<h1>To the English Department at A University.</h1>
<p>
Chinmin Institute of Technology is closing down its AFL Department, and I am now looking for another job, so I wish to apply for the contract-based positions teaching English at your university. I think I would be an asset to your school.

</p>
<p>
For the seven years I have been in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been working with lower-level, unmotivated students. With these students, I had to rework the way I teach. I had to move away from pairwork and groupwork to work with the whole class, because the students were generally unwilling to use English unless the teacher was observing them. 

</p>
<p>
Instead, for homework I had them work in pairs doing simple dictation exercises that I hoped they might be willing to do in English. I attempted to prevent the collusion that I thought was more likely in this homework by making the partners adversaries. Whether I was successful in preventing collusion is debatable, but overall I think I did an excellent job of creating favorable attitudes to English and to schoolwork among these students, at the same time as I significantly raised their levels of achievement. I certainly seem to have gained their respect.

</p>
<p>
My success was partly the result of my technique, the result of the activities I devised to get them to do to use English to learn the language, and partly the result of the personal warmth I felt and showed to them as my students, the result of who I am as a person. No doubt the latter is more important than the former. I place more importance on the technique however. I wish to continue developing that technique.

</p>
<p>
Now, I am ready to apply the lessons I have learned here to the practice I developed before in Korea where I also taught university students. I believe I am well suited to teaching at the university level. Even though my master&#39;s is not in TESOL, my native intelligence, my background in psychology and my extensive reading in TESOL and applied linguistics fit me for an academic position.

</p>
<p>
I am more interested in the practice, that is, in teaching itself, than in the theory, that is, in knowledge about learning and language, but I also recognize, as Kurt Lewin noted, that there is nothing as practical as a good theory. I hope that your department is also interested in such a collaboration between theory and practice. If it is, I look forward to working with you at your university developing superior speakers and writers of the English language.
