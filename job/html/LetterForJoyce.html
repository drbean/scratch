Not just a pretty face, Joyce has the English skills to match her looks. In particular, it is her listening ability that struck me most, and her willingness to check with me when she didn&#39;t understand.

</p>
<p>
Overall, her grades were always in the top half of the class, if not at the very top of the class, especially in conversation and listening. In composition, she was also able, and her grades in this subject were good too, although not outstanding.

</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t say that I know her very well, seeing as we were teacher and student, but she was always cheerful throughout the two years she was in my class. She always struck me as confident without being cocky, positive without being aggressive, and friendly without being forward.

</p>
<p>
Altogether she made a most good impression.

</p>
<p>
I remember one time when I became upset because some low-ability students did not have the skills or the courage to answer questions in a class discussion, even though they appeared to want to. She came up to me after class and said, Don&#39;t be sad. It makes us sad too.

</p>
<p>
I believe these English skills and her inter-personal skills ready her to take on any challenge she sets her mind to, either academically or in the workplace, if she is willing to apply herself to it.

</p>
<p>
So, I have no hesitation in recommending her for any position she seeks.

</p>
<p>
I wish her good luck.
