<p>
I've had my first real experience of tutoring here. My previous encounters with the students have mostly been the result of me approaching them, rather than them approaching me. It WAS gratifying, reassuring and confidence-building to meet some graduates of my old school, who have become students here.

</p>

<p>
But April, an Environmental Engineering 4th-year undergraduate (AKA senior) has been forward in exploiting my availabilty as a tutor in the Self-Access English Learning Room.

</p>

<p>
She wants to do a master's at National Taiwan University and we are going through old English entrance exams at NTU.

</p>

<p>
Almost immediately we hit on a good method. She does the questions at home beforehand. Then she reads the question to me and either she or I answer it.

</p>

<p>
This challenges me too, so is more interesting than my just reading the question and giving her my answer.

</p>

<p>
Her reading comprehension and vocabulary are excellent, and generally her pronunciation is good. But she has the common problem here of confusing /n/ and /m/ and her diphthongs are not distinguisable from short vowels. For example, she read, 'name names' and I heard, 'name them.' I don't know to what extent I should correct her diphthongs, because there must be native speakers who pronounce them the same as her. Do you know who such natives are, not distinguishing 'whale' and 'well', for example?

</p>

<p>
I explain vocabulary she is interested in, giving definitions and expamples in English. This is still easy for me. [Easier than teaching big classes of beginning, unmotivated students.] After all I did ace the Verbal Reasoning section of the GRE. But it is interesting having to generate this kind of material on demand, giving my verbal skills a work-out, something I feel like I haven't been doing for a long time since copy-editing at the newspaper perhaps.

</p>

<p>
One thing I did have trouble with however was one question about mistakes connecting cause and effect. The question presents a short passage about the misattribution of the cause of sickness resulting from food poisoning to the most distinctively flavored food eaten at the meal. It says children are particularly susceptible to this mistake.

</p>

<p>
It then asks which of the answers, if true, best supports the argument. We could not see which one is supposed to be the correct answer.

</p>


<p>
The question of linking cause and effect is interesting to me in my work as a teacher. [I feel like I'm wrapped in cotton wool. Nothing I do has an effect.]


</p>

<p>
The question: Someone who gets sick from eating a meal will often develop a strong distate for the one food in the meal that had the most distinctive flavor, whether or not that food caused the sickness. This phenomenon explains why children are especially likely to develop strong aversions to some foods.

<\p><p>
Which one of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the explanation?

<\p><p>
A. Children are more likely than adults to be given meals composed of food lacking especially distinctive flavors.
B. Children are less likely than adults to see a connection between their health and the foods they eat.
C. Children tend to have more acute taste and to become sick more often than adults do.
D. Children typically recover more slowly than adults do from sickness caused by food.
