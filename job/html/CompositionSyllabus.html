In a composition class, I would actually do little writing in 
class, unless it were in a computer lab. I would however have the 
students in week 4, 9, 13 and 18 spend the whole of the class 
time writing essays, effectively converting the midterm and final 
exams into informal writing-in-class experiences. As a result, I 
would have 4 tests in my assessment schedule &#40;instead of the 
traditional 2&#41;. Each test would be worth 10 points for a total of 
40 percent of the grade.

</p>
<p>
Instead of having students write in class, I would assign writing 
homework each week, having them write an assessed essay in a 
notebook every second week and write to a class wiki &#40;as at 
<a href="http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi&#41;">http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi&#41;</a>, in 
alternate weeks. Each of these essays would be worth 5 points for 
a total of 40 percent of the grade. The homework thus would have 
equivalent weight to that of the exams. Traditionally, homework 
contributes much less to the grade.

</p>
<p>
The final 20 percent would be for classwork and wiki writing. The 
reason I wouldn&#39;t do much writing in class, at least with 
lower-level students, is that with them, I have never been 
successful in a process approach in my classes, even though I 
believe it is theoretically the correct way to teach composition.

</p>
<p>
I rationalized this failure as due to the difference between the 
view of writing as watercolor painting &#40;Chinese painting&#41; and the 
view of writing as oil painting &#40;Western painting&#41;. My students 
saw their work as unretouchable and uneditable, as accomplished, 
as unanalyzable. It was easier to write a new essay, than to 
rewrite an old essay. It was easier for them to write an essay, 
than to read each others&#39; essays! This inversion of the usual 
situation where it is easier for you, the reader to read this, 
than it is for me, the writer to write it, makes the process 
approach very hard to institute.

</p>
<p>
In some situations, I was able to get the students to read each 
others&#39; essays, as for example when the topic was very 
interesting and personal, or the class was a new one and the 
students didn&#39;t know each other very well. However, this was 
unsustainable over the long term. This was disappointing for me.

</p>
<p>
That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t enjoy teaching composition, however. I 
perhaps enjoy it even more than teaching conversation. I find 
writing very interesting. I enjoy writing in English, but do none 
in my second languages! The challenge is to make writing in 
English interesting for my students and to get them to think 
about personal issues.

</p>
<p>
The way writing differs from conversation is that there is more 
time to think and more distance from the listener/reader. I take 
the writing class as an opportunity for my students to think 
about who they are and where they are going and to communicate 
their reflections in a foreign language. English is a language 
which is not native to them and which thus frees them to some 
extent from the rules and habits of thought and the constraints 
imposed on their expression in the first-language situation.

</p>
<p>
Thus I would tell my students that I&#39;m interested more in the 
content than in whether they are writing grammatically. I would 
tell them grammar is important, but more important is what they 
say. Agreeing with Curtis Kelly that &#39;Writing from within&#39; is 
important, I would ask them to reflect on their own selves and to 
think psychologically.

</p>
<p>
Influenced by Kelly&#39;s choice of topics, if given the free choice, 
I would start with &#39;interests&#39; in the first 4-week section. 
Students would write 2 essays in that period, one on their 
interests, one on their partner&#39;s interests. I would ask the 
students to say how their interests differ and why. With some of 
my students in the past having had difficulty identifying their 
interests, in the first 2 weeks I would raise awareness of the 
sorts of interest which exist and get them to analyze why they 
like what they do, by asking them what they like about the thing 
they do.

</p>
<p>
With the first essay, I could identify who likes what and why and 
have students match 2 sets of cards, each one in the first set 
with an interest and each one in the second with the name of a 
student. In the second essay, I would expect the student to 
engage with the interests of his/her partner. I would grade the 
essay on the degree to which the student did this, as well as on 
organization/grammar and interest.

</p>
<p>
In weeks 5-8, I would move onto &#39;dreams,&#39; which students have 
probably less experience talking about and which is more 
personal. I would ask students to analyze why they had this 
dream, what they were doing now that was connected to the dream 
and what they planned to do in the short term and long term that 
was connected to the dream. I would grade the students essays on 
the degree to which they engaged with my questions.

</p>
<p>
In weeks 10-12, I would ask students to think about and to ask 
other people what they thought about them. This is even more 
personal, and perhaps stressful for some, so I would make sure 
positive feelings and views were expressed. This issue could also 
be developed into an approach to research methods, including such 
topics as the formulation of questions for a questionnaire and 
the writing of a research report with introduction, method, 
results, discussion and conclusion.

</p>
<p>
In weeks 14-17, I would ask students to tell a story about a 
problem they were still in the process of trying to solve &#40;or 
alternatively, had already solved.&#41; I would ask them to ask other 
people for advice. I would ask their partners to give them 
advice. I would ask them to evaluate their solutions. This topic 
is one I haven&#39;t actually tried with a class yet. It is not in 
Kelly&#39;s Writing from Within.

</p>
<p>
One activity that would be common to each of these sections would 
be self-evaluation of essays. Does their self-evaluation 
correspond to my evaluation of their essay? If it does, they win 
points. They fill out a form when handing in their essay to be 
graded. If they give themselves the same grade I give them, I 
give them points when I hand back their essay. This way I hope to 
encourage self-evaluation and reflection on the process of 
writing.

</p>
<p>
Another way I encourage attention to process is setting the same 
&#40;or very similar&#41; prompts in the exam topics in weeks 4,9,13,18 
as for the homework. Students can remember what they wrote and 
use that memory to &#39;virtually&#39; rewrite or edit their earlier 
essays.

</p>
<p>
By having students write about themselves first and then about 
their partners later, a process which encourages them to read 
their partner&#39;s essay, I am also giving them the opportunity to 
approach writing as an iterative or recursive process, the 
distinctive feature of the process approach, I think.

</p>
<p>
In the second semester, I would start teaching 
<a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/lab_report_complete.html">IMRD Reports</a> and ask 
them to use this structure to do <a href="http://momotaro/HomePage/index.cgi?ActionResearch" class="empty">ActionResearch</a> on their own 
language learning.

</p>
<p>
At the same time, I would get them to write stories like this one 
of mine, <a href="MyMusic.html">MyMusic</a>.
