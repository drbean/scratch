Devising a speaking and listening course, I would first consider 
my objectives. These would depend on who the students were. With 
perfect students, the objectives become obvious. Such students 
would teach themselves through interaction in English with me. As 
a native-speaker, I would be trying to communicate at a deep 
level with them, trying to establish bonds with them, and trying 
to initiate them into the culture of the English speaker.  With 
them, I could use a perfect methodology, a communicative, 
task-based approach, that emphasized autonomous learning and 
working in groups. 

</p>
<p>
With the students I have been teaching for the last seven years 
however, such good students are few. These students lack 
confidence, don&#39;t enjoy interacting in English and are not 
prepared to take risks communicating. My goals with such students 
would be to promote confidence they can use English to 
communicate, alleviate the stress they feel communicating in 
English and encourage more adventurousness speaking and listening 
to the language.

</p>
<p>
At the same time, I would be trying to keep these students 
on-task, preventing them from finding opportunities to avoid 
using the language, or to avoid confronting their problems with 
language learning, by sleeping or not coming to class, or not 
participating in class activities, for example. 

</p>
<p>
Thus my aim would be a light-hearted, fun course, but at the same 
time, to communicate I had firm expectations that all students 
would make the effort to learn.

</p>
<p>
I would try to lighten the deadening effect of midterm and final 
exams by making them shorter and more informal. Having no 
assessment, on the other hand, would permit students to avoid 
confronting their language learning problems, so I would have 4 
informal, speaking-and-listening exams in weeks 4,9,13 and 18, 
each worth 15 percent of the grade.

</p>
<p>
For classes of good students, this informal exam would be a 
<a href="JigSaw.html">JigSaw</a> activity. For classes of unmotivated students &#40;and 
non-English majors perhaps&#41;, it would be a pair dictation 
activity.

</p>
<p>
Thus these 4 exams would split the semester up into 4 sections. 
In these 4 sections, the language and cultural material I would 
be trying to teach would be exemplified in 2 or 3 dialogues that 
were similar to each other, in terms of grammar or language 
function, or in terms of cultural content.

</p>
<p>
The good classes would use the material to do communicative 
tasks, and other activities oriented to language use, for 
non-language ends, eg give advice, or solve puzzles. The basic 
classes would practice the material in different contexts, eg 
dictation, context-spotting, definitions, and quizzes, that is, 
in activities directed at language usage.

</p>
<p>
The dialogues I would choose would be interesting because of 
conflict between the protagonists, which was resolved, or was 
expressed, for example. Although the language might be simple, 
the language functions would be subtle and layered, with complex 
meanings.

</p>
<p>
The dialogues would thus be about complex human interactions, 
expressive of the deep relationships people have with each other, 
even though the language itself might be quite simple.

</p>
<p>
Usually, I take my dialogs, specifically, and language and 
cultural materials, in general, from the textbooks I am given, or 
have acquired. I don&#39;t have any strong preferences.

</p>
<p>
With the dialogs, I am doing most of my own materials development 
at the moment. Dictation and the use of cards is a distinctive 
feature of my courses. Dictation can be boring, but with the 
computer-generated materials I have developed where students have 
to fill in letters, rather than words, the students generally 
find it interesting. This is because there are limited choices 
and feedback is precise and generally quick. There is less 
confusion. The confusion that occurs is more easily resolveable. 
This is motivating.

</p>
<p>
Class dictations where 1 or 2 students read the passage and the 
rest of the class, tries to fill in the letters is, surprisingly 
quite interesting to my lower-level students at the moment.

</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t use dictation as much with higher-level students. With 
them, communication, or use of language for non-language ends, in 
other words, listening and speaking AND thinking, must be an 
objective. With lower-level students, they may resist more than 
encoding &#40;into speech&#41; and decoding &#40;into a representation of 
speech&#41;, the psychological processes involved in dictation.
