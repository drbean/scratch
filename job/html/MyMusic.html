This incident must have happened when I was about 7-8. One night,
my mom and dad let me stay up a bit later than my younger
brothers, who were 6 and 3. They went to bed at 8 pm, but I sat
up with my mom and dad. I felt very proud of being a big boy. 

</p>
<p>
My dad likes classical music a lot, and I had looked at some
books about classical music that he had. I read something about a
composer called Schumann. 

</p>
<p>
I started to talk to my parents about Schumann. But I pronounced
the word, &#39;skamen,&#39; rather than &#39;shuman.&#39; I probably thought that
<em>sch</em> should be pronounced as in the word &#39;school.&#39;

</p>
<p>
My mom and dad laughed at me. I suddenly lost the feeling that I
was grown up.  I had mixed feelings about being laughed at. In
some ways, I liked them to laugh at me. In other ways, I didn&#39;t
like them to laugh at me.

</p>
<p>
I think probably I also had mixed feelings about being grown up.
I didn&#39;t think being grown up was such a great thing, perhaps.

</p>
<p>
I think I lost interest in music from that point until I became
about 19, when I started getting interested in music again. I
wanted to get involved with new music, however. I wanted to find
music that was different than the music my father liked and other
people liked too.
