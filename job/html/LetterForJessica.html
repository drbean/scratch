<p>
To Whom It May Concern,

</p>
<p>
When I learned that Jessica wanted to become a secretary, I was disappointed.
&#39;Oh, Jessica, you&#39;re capable of more than that,&#39; I thought. But further
consideration of the role of a secretary, someone who works on behalf of
another, led me to realize that Jessica is well-suited for what is a worthy
career.

</p>
<p>
In the English composition class I taught, in which I tried to get students to
look within to create goals for the future and to understand what had happened
to them in the past, Jessica consistently showed insight into her own character
and that of others in her class. She was able to say what made classmates and
members of her family tick, not in a superior or demeaning way, but a gentle
and supportive one, that reflected well both on who she was writing about and
on herself. Such understanding of psychology was unusual in the class. Her
ability to put herself in other people&#39;s shoes both made her stand out and at
the same time, I think, fits her for the role of secretary, a role which is as
much interpersonal as functional.

</p>
<p>
One particular essay, in which I had asked the students to write about their
goals for the future, especially impressed me. She talked about her dream of
being a secretary, but more importantly, she talked about her attitude to
learning after she left school. The excitement she conveyed about learning:
&#39;Learn, learn, learn,&#39; she said, was infectious. I suggested to her that she
use the essay, all her own work I believe, as a self-introduction. I felt that
it was far more impressive than the usual artificial introduction most students
struggle over, even with much outside help.

</p>
<p>
Last, I think I need to mention Jessica&#39;s unfailing cheerfulness. She always
seemed to have a smile for people. I was sometimes a demanding teacher, and
some students had problems with that, but Jessica never complained. She just
did the work. It always raised my spirits to see her come into class and smile.

</p>
<p>
So, I heartily recommend Jessica for any position as secretary she cares to
seek, most likely in a foreign company, because her English is good, of course,
but indeed anywhere that she can continue life-long learning. I believe, I
hope, she will accomplish much.

</p>
<p>
Sincerely,



</p>
<p>
