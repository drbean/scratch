In a reading and discussion class, I would actually do a little 
writing for homework. I might even have the students in week 4, 
9, 13 and 18 spend half of the lesson writing essays, effectively 
converting the midterm and final exams into an informal writing-
before-discussion experience. As a result, I would have 4 tests in 
my assessment schedule &#40;instead of the traditional 2&#41;. Each test 
would be worth 10 points for a total of 40 percent of the grade.

</p>
<p>
As well as having students write a little in class, I would 
assign readings as homework each week, having them answer 
questions on an Internet page and leave notes on a class wiki &#40;as 
at <a href="http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi&#41;">http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi&#41;</a>.
Each of these readings would be worth 2 points for a total of 20 
percent of the grade. The homework thus would have equivalent 
weight to a midterm or final exam. Traditionally, homework contributes 
much less to the grade.

</p>
<p>
The final 40 percent would be for classwork discussion. This is 
the most important part of the class. The weekly class discussion 
provides the most 

</p>
<p>
The ideal is to have content about which the students are excited 
and want to express themselves. This suggests giving some control 
over the topics of the class. The students like the security of a 
textbook, but it sets the syllabus for the whole of the semester, 
and it isn&#39;t very flexible.

I rationalized this failure as due to the difference between the 
view of writing as watercolor painting &#40;Chinese painting&#41; and the 
view of writing as oil painting &#40;Western painting&#41;. My students 
saw their work as unretouchable and uneditable, as accomplished, 
as unanalyzable. It was easier to write a new essay, than to 
rewrite an old essay. It was easier for them to write an essay, 
than to read each others&#39; essays! This inversion of the usual 
situation where it is easier for you, the reader to read this, 
than it is for me, the writer to write it, makes the process 
approach very hard to institute.
