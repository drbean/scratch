It quickly becomes obvious, talking to Kevin, that his English is very good. As an example, the requesting of this letter of recommendation. Having told me two or three weeks ago that he wanted me to write one, yesterday he told me that he needed it tomorrow. The fact that he was able to do this completely naturally, completely grammatically and completely politely testifies to his ability.

</p>
<p>
On longer acquaintance, however, one also sees that his conversational English skills are accompanied by listening and writing skills of comparable quality. I am not able to speak for his reading skills as I never taught him reading.

</p>
<p>
As for the source of these skills, I am not sure. He has told me he speaks English with an English-speaking relative. He has also consistently said his dream is to be a translator.

</p>
<p>
Reflecting now on his qualities as I approach the end of my acquaintance with him, my only wish is that he would have more consistently applied himself. Because of this he was not able to match the high-performing women in my classes over the two years I taught this cohort.

</p>
<p>
Coupled with this English ability, and offsetting the relative lack of application, is an engaging personality. He is always pleasant, always good-humored, always popular. It was always good to see him.

</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not too sure why he wants this letter of recommendation. I think he intends to continue studying. I wish him all the luck in the future in whatever path he takes, and without hesitation recommend him for any position he might seek to apply for. I cannot praise him too highly.

</p>
<p>
For my letter of recommendation policy, see <a href="http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/HomePage/?WritingLettersofRecommendation">http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/HomePage/?WritingLettersofRecommendation</a>

</p>
<p>
Saying goodbye to him, I am confident that he can build on the basis of the personal attributes he has already developed. I hope he becomes an outstanding person in the social arena and the path in life which he chooses to follow, something he has all the prospects of achieving.
