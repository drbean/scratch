<p>
To Whom It May Concern,

</p>
<p>
When Stella first asked me for a recommendation letter, I refused. She and      Sweety hadn&#39;t stood out in the class. They didn&#39;t seem very interested in      writing about their dreams or analyzing themselves. I knew Stella dreamed of   being a dancer, but as far as language was concerned, she often took the easy option of discussing problems in Japanese with me rather than the more         challenging one of risking failing to communicate with a native speaker.

</p>
<p>
However, something must have been kindled in Stella&#39;s heart &#40;not of course of my doing&#41;, because her increased activity in writing in her notebook and on the web <a href="http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi?StellaShiu">http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/kwiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi?StellaShiu</a> through the 6-8 weeks to the end of the semester showed me that she could do the work, at the same time as it convinced me that I could honestly recommend her to anyone unsure about whether to accept her or not.

</p>
<p>
Although gentle, she seemed to enjoy interacting with me. Her sense of humor    will stand her in good stead. I hope she is able to continue dancing, whether as a career or a hobby. Though I never saw her dance, I am convinced the passion she showed for it will allow her, as a doer, to acquit herself honorably in this and other activities she undertakes.

</p>
<p>
I heartily recommend Stella Shiu.

</p>
<p>
Sincerely,



</p>
