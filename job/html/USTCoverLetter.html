<h1>To the English Department at A University of Science and Technology</h1>
<p>
Chinmin Institute of Technology is closing down its AFL
Department, and I am now looking for another job, so I wonder if
you have any contract-based positions teaching English in the AFL
department at your university. I think I would be well-suited for 
teaching in your department.

</p>
<p>
For the seven years I have been in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been
working with lower-level, unmotivated students. With these
students, I had to rework the way I teach. I had to move away
from pairwork and groupwork to work with the whole class, because
the students were generally unwilling to use English unless the
teacher was observing them. 

</p>
<p>
But this was perhaps a blessing in disguise. It forced me to
develop a number of innovative activities to get the students to
use English. For example, for exams I had them do pair
dictations, each student reading one half of a dialogue to their
partner, and writing down their partner&#39;s lines.

</p>
<p>
Successes such as these were rewarding, but whether I achieved a
lot of what I set out to achieve in my teaching is debatable. Overall,
however, I think I did do an excellent job of creating favorable
attitudes to English among these students, at the same time as I
significantly raised their levels of achievement. I certainly
seem to have gained their respect.

</p>
<p>
My success was partly the result of my technique, and partly the
result of the personal warmth I felt and showed to them as my
students. No doubt the latter is more important than the former.
I place more importance on the technique however. I wish to
continue developing that technique.

</p>
<p>
Now, I am ready to apply the lessons I have learned here to the
practice I developed before in Korea where I taught
university students. I believe I am well suited to teaching at
the university level. Even though my master&#39;s is not in TESOL, my
native intelligence, my background in psychology and my extensive
reading in TESOL and applied linguistics fit me for an academic
position.

</p>
<p>
However, I am more interested in the practice, that is, in teaching
itself, than in the theory, that is, in knowledge about learning
and language. At the same time, I recognize, as Kurt Lewin noted, that
there is nothing as practical as a good theory. I hope that your
department is also interested in such a collaboration between
theory and practice. If it is, I would enjoy working with you 
there developing superior speakers and writers of the English
language.


</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely,


</p>
