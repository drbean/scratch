Dear Sir/Madam,

I may have contacted you last year in connection with the closing down of Chinmin Institute of Technology's AFL Department. Surprisingly, I was not laid off at that time. But with the graduation of the last cohort of students this June, I am now being dismissed. I am again looking for another job, and I wish to apply for a position at your school. I think I would be an asset to your English department, even as a part-time teacher.

For the ten years I have been in Taiwan, I have been working with lower-level, unmotivated students at Chinmin. This has been a challenge, but I was able to develop a number of communicative activities that interested them, for example, pair dictation, where partners read a dialog to each other and write it down.

Whether I was successful in a lot of my work here is debatable, but overall I think I did an excellent job of creating favorable attitudes to English and to school work among these students. I certainly seem to have gained their respect.

It has also definitely been harder work and more of a challenge than teaching the university classes I had in Korea. But with this experience under my belt, I think I am an even more capable teacher than I was before, able to handle classes where there is a mix of high-achieving, confident students, ie good students, together with bad students, ie disaffected students, who are uncomfortable with English and don't find any enjoyment trying to learn the language.

If there are such classes at your school, I would welcome the challenge of teaching them, as I seek to achieve my own goals of development of my teaching repertoire and of helping my students grow as learners of English.

My desire is to have an effect on my learners by seeing them learn the language and I feel the future is bright. If your school is also of such a view, I would enjoy working with you, developing confident, relaxed, adventurous and superior speakers of the English language.

Yours sincerely,


Greg Matheson
