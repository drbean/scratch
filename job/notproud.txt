I am looking for a part-time job at your school. My master's is
in educational leadership, not TESOL, but look at my old GRE
scores!

Not only do I have a high IQ, I also have a high EQ. I am
sensitive to my students needs. I am caring of their feelings. At
the same time, I am strong-willed. I have goals I want to achieve
in the classroom, although I am strategically and tactically
flexible on how I go about achieving these goals. Achieving
these goals is what drives me. I want to make each and every
student the language learner I was not able to become.

Whether I was able to do this at my present school is debatable.
However, I am proud of how I helped my students there. I look
forward to the chance to help the students at your school develop
as language learners too.

This job application is coming just a month and a half before the
new semester, so it is likely you don't have any positions at
your school. If you can't offer me a job, I would appreciate it
if you could forward this email on to a school which is looking
for teachers.

I am an experienced, enthusiatic, and effective teacher and I am
willing to travel and to work teaching all kinds of
students--from children to adults.
