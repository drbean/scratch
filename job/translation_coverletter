I saw your advertisement on http://www.tealit.com.tw, and wondered if you were looking for copy editors. As you can see from my resume, I worked for 10 years copyediting at the Korea Times (http://www.koreatimes.co.kr), one of the 2 major English-language daily newspapers in Korea.

I have only basic Chinese-language ability, but my Japanese and Korean are a lot better and I could translate from those languages into English.

I have also done copyediting of academic journal articles by Korean and Taiwanese college professors.

I believe i) my superior English language skills (see my GRE scores in the resume), ii) the care with which I express myself for the benefit of non-native speakers, and iii) my desire to understand even poorly-expressed material allow me to do an excellent job, both translating and copyediting.

I am teaching in the Language Center at National United University in Miaoli, part-time. I would be interested in working for you from home, with occasional visits to your offices.

I'm including a resume. A longer curriculum vitae is available on my web page, at http://drbean.freeshell.org.
