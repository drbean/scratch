I am looking for a part-time job at your school. I don't have a
master's in TESOL, or a PhD. My master's is in educational 
administration. But look at my old GRE scores! Perhaps not genius 
class, but a total of 2270 is a score to be proud of. Only one 
percent of GRE takers has a verbal intelligence higher than mine.

But not only do I have a high IQ, I also have a high EQ. I am
sensitive to my students needs. I am caring of their feelings. At
the same time, I am strong-willed. I have goals I want to achieve
in the classroom, although I am strategically and tactically
flexible on how I go about achieving these goals. But achieving
these goals is what drives me. I want to make each and every
student the language learner I was not able to become.

Actually I am a modest man. More than being proud of myself and
of my achievements, I am proud of my students at Chinmin
Institute of Technology, and I look forward to the chance to be
proud of the students at your school too.

Throw caution to the winds. Give me a job ;-)

This job application is coming just a month and a half before the
new semester, so it is likely you don't have any positions at
your school. If you can't offer me a job, I would appreciate it
if you could forward this email on to a school which is looking
for teachers.

I am an experienced, enthusiatic, and effective teacher and I am
willing to travel and to work teaching all kinds of
students--from children to adults.
