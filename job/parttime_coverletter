I found your email address on http://www.tealit.com.tw. Are you looking for a dedicated, experienced, effective native-speaker teacher?

I am looking for part-time work. I think I would be an asset to your school.

I am teaching in the Language Center at National United University in Miaoli, part-time. I want to fill up my schedule with other part-time work in Hsinchu or Taichung. My classes for the fall semester at NUU are on Monday morning and afternoon and on Thursday and Friday morning. I have made commitments to teach elsewhere on Tuesday mornings and Friday afternoons 1-3 pm and on Saturday, 6-7 pm. Other than that, I'm free.

I'm including a resume. A longer curriculum vitae is available on my web page, at http://drbean.freeshell.org, together with some essays about teaching,

Even if you can't give me work, I would enjoy the opportunity to meet to talk about teaching English in Taiwan.
