		AVAILABILITY

I am teaching in the Language Center at National United
University in Miaoli, part-time. I want to fill up my
schedule with other part-time work in Miaoli, Hsinchu
or Taichung.

I have lost my 2 classes at 育達. The school is cutting 
back on part-time teachers. I'm looking to fill up the 
Thursdays left free by this.

I also have other free periods. My classes for the fall
semester at NUU are on Monday morning and afternoon.
Tuesdays and Fridays look good at this point.
