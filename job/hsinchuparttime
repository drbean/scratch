I may have already contacted you about a full-time job. I have an
offer of a part-time job at a college in Hsinchu, and I'm now
looking to see if I can fill up my schedule with other part-time jobs
in the Hsinchu area.

If you haven't already read it, my cover letter and resume may
interest you.  If you have read it, please feel free to forward
it on to any other school which might be looking for a part-time
teacher. I am most interested in working in the formal school
system, but I am willing to teach at any level, high school and
above.


                       COVER LETTER

Chinmin Institute of Technology is closing down its AFL
Department, and I am now looking for another job, so I wish to
apply for a position at your school. I think I would be an asset
to your English department.

National United University has decided to employ an Assistant Professor
with a PhD, a degree I do not have, so I am now looking for another job. Do you 
have any vacancies at your school? I think I would be an asset
to your English department.
