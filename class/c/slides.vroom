== Classwork grade decisions

Who should decide the classwork grades?

- the teacher: 
  This way
- the students:
  One table of 2 groups decides which group gets
  3 which group gets 2.

----
== Dr Bean's reasons

- The students should be active. Teacher grading makes students
  passive.
- Students need to set goals. Deciding/saying why some other
  person did an excellent job gives students a goal for themselves.

----
== But, students resist self-assessment

---- include names.vroom

---- include questions.vroom

---- include conversation.vroom

---- include drbean.vroom

---- include comp.vroom
