Table Number and Subject: Exam 2

Column 1: Write 'Web negotiation'

Fold the card over, so White can't see Black's
answer, and Black can't see White's answer.

If you don't fold the cards, YOU ONLY GET ONE POINT.
You MUST ANSWER THE CARDS INDIVIDUALLY.

1. Go to http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/business/exam2soundfiles.html
to listen to the first question.
2. Either i) answer the question straight away, or 
ii) go away, ask selves more questions on the
Question competition card and come back
3. Either i) continue with same topic on Question
Card, or ii) do new topic.

== Change topics at any time

Write answers on right line.

----
== Continue until there is a winner

On the Question competition card:

Mark the winner's names with a check mark (v)

You must continue until one person gives
up. If you have the same scores, I will
give the winning score to the person who
has the role with the fewest winners in
the competition this week. (White?)
