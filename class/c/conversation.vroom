Conversation Competition

by Dr Bean

----
== The idea

2 champions from 2 groups ask each other questions

The other members of the group listen and support their
champion with questions to ask the other champion.

Your champion is your representative of your group.
Only your champion speaks to the other group.

----
== Conversation is like tennis

== Scoring

The listeners decide who is the winner. They
think: 

Who is the last person to speak?
Who asks most questions?
Who has most right answers?
Who asks the best questions?
Who asks most of the questions Dr Bean
	introduced in the lesson.
Who speaks English the best?

----
== Procedure

1. Dr Bean says who is competing.
eg, The Champion in the Black Group, C and the Champion
in the Blue Group, C talk to each other.

2. B and A help Champions prepare questions and answers.

3. The 2 Champions start talking to each other.
B and A cannot talk to the other group.
They can only help C in their own group.

4. The 2 Champions stop talking.

5. B & A in the 2 groups vote for who won.
3-1, 1-3, 4-0, 0-4. No 2-2.

6. If the 2 groups cannot agree on a winner,
the 2 Champions must start talking again.

OR, B and A in the 2 groups come to Dr Bean
at the end of the class and say why they chose
the Champion they did.

They say: X was the last person to speak. X
had most right answers. X asked the best
questions. X spoke English the best.

and tests the other person, who answers the question.

The questioner gets the point if the answer isn't correct.

Battleship Style:
In Battleship style, the questioner doesn't have the answers.
They ask the other person, who tells them whether they are
correct or not. If the questioner is correct, they get the point.
