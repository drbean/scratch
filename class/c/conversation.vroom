Conversation Competition

by Dr Bean

----
== The idea

2 champions from 2 groups ask each other questions

The other members of the group listen and support their
champion with questions to ask the other champion.

Your champion is your representative of your group.
Only your champion speaks to the other group.

----
== Conversation is like tennis

== Scoring

The listeners decide who is the winner. They
think: 

Who is the last person to speak?
Who asks most questions?
Who has most right answers?
Who asks the best questions?
Who asks most of the questions Dr Bean
	introduced in the lesson.
Who speaks English the best?

----
== Procedure

1. Dr Bean says who is competing.
eg, The Champion in the Black Group, C and the Champion
in the Blue Group, C talk to each other.

2. B and A help Champions prepare questions and answers.

3. The 2 Champions start talking to each other.
B and A cannot talk to the other group.
They can only help C in their own group.

4. The 2 Champions stop talking.

5. B & A in the 2 groups vote for who won.
3-1, 1-3, 4-0, 0-4. No 2-2.

6. If the 2 groups cannot agree on a winner,
the 2 Champions must start talking again.

OR, B and A in the 2 groups come to Dr Bean
at the end of the class and say why they chose
the Champion they did.

They say: X was the last person to speak. X
had most right answers. X asked the best
questions. X spoke English the best.

----
Dr Bean decides the winner

At some (not all) tables, Dr Bean will listen
to spokespersons say WHY they chose one of the 
champions rather than the other.

Not WHO, WHY.  

If Dr Bean thinks that what one spokesperson
describes are characteristics of a better 
performance or learning behavior, he will give
the points to the team of that spokesperson.

----
Variant 

1. Conversations in pairs, perhaps asking questions from
board, but going beyond those questions to talk about
other things.
2. Think about the merits of the other person's performance.
3. Tell Dr Bean and the others.
4. Dr Bean decides whose report is the winner. He will decide
on the basis of the content, ie the performance of the other 
person, and style of the report.
5. The points go to the reporter.
to the reporter.

text to the first champion and the champion tries to fill in 
the first line of A: blanks.

The champion can say, How do you spell Sam's.

text to the second champion and the second champion fills in 
the second line of B: blanks.

cards and decide who the winner is. Who got more words correct?
Whose listening is better?

+5. If the 2 groups cannot decide, Dr Bean will listen to the reasons
of the champions' supporters. Why did they choose the champion they
chose?

== 2 CompComp Question Styles

Normal, Tennis Style:
In a normal quiz competition, the questioner knows the answers
and tests the other person, who answers the question.
The answerer gets the point if they are correct.
The questioner gets the point if the answer isn't correct.

Battleship Style:
In Battleship style, the questioner doesn't have the answers.
They ask the other person, who tells them whether they are
correct or not. If the questioner is correct, they get the point.
	
----
== Battleship Rules

1. In turn, White first.
2. Wait 30 seconds.
3. Is the question well-formed?
4. The answerer must answer truthfully.
5. You can't repeat your question, but you can use
	your partner/others' questions.
6. You can't look at partner's card.
7. The person who asks most questions and gets most
	questions answered is the winner.
8. Winners get 5 points
   Losers get 3 points.
9. You can't ask questions you know the answer to.
