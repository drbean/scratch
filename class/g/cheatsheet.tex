If someone uses Chinese, the card handler
talks with the Announcer, who says: "No Chinese!", and marks
the name of the Chinese user on the seating chart each time he/she uses Chinese.

I will give you a grade for your work as an examiner. If I see no record of Chinese use on the seating chart, I may think you didn't do a good job and you should have a low grade.
