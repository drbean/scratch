## The Internet as a way to learn English

- Pros:
	- Same experience as in US.

- Cons:
	- Unnatural, not as close, intimate as face-to-face. No body language.
	- Communication is narrow, restricted.
	- Disables learners. Like blind people,
	learners-  have to use machines to work around their disability.
	- Breaks easily. Not permanent. Web pages disappear. It's harder to lose books or CD's.

## Using Anki in a browser

[http://ankiweb.net](http://ankiweb.net)

## Problems with flashcards

* Non-contextualized (just single words)
* Language-focused (not communication-focused),
	so meaningless
* Every repetition is the same (no change in the presentation)
	but in the real world, the presented word always changes

## Problems using flashcards

- How to use?

- If not practiced, no use.

- Many flash cards make a collection or deck. Too many cards is same problem as not using the cards.

- Answer: use the cards which you didn't see recently, or forgot last time.

	What do you think?

	Name"

## Homework Week 14

A message to a penpal or forum, with a link, or copy posted on ec.must.edu.tw

PLUS, a reply from someone to your message.

## Sit back and wait till communications roll in.

- They won't roll in.
  	- Perhaps they are not interested in your topic.
	- Perhaps they are shy.
	- Perhaps they feel you aren't a member of the group.

- Introduces discussion forum
  	- types of messages, eg on a clothes site: about jackets, pants
	- participants eg fashion designers, clothes buyers
	- types of communications eg light/heavy, conversational/academic, short/long, etc
	- number of messages eg many messages a day, 1 or 2 a month
	- types of interaction eg long-running threads/little response to individual messages
