          Okay. The software I use to study Japanese is Mnemosyne. And this is the Mnemosyne project homepage. It's an open-source free software for Windows, Linux, and the Mac. I use it on Windows. I even put it on a USB stick. And I can study from home, at one of my jobs when I have some free time, Internet cafes, anywhere there is a computer.

          And it's amazing. Absolutely amazing. I use it to study kanji. I use it to study phrases. I use it to study pictures. I use it to study. And, it's amazing.

          Um, most of these memorization software (and there's a lot out there), are based on the Leitner system. And I went to Wikipedia, Flashcard, and it has something about the Leitner system. Right here.

          Basically, there's, there are some boxes. And the idea is, that all the new information sits on the left. And you test yourself. So, for example, if you had ten flashcards here, you'd test yourself. You'd flip the first one, and decide, do I actually know this. If you know the answer, it goes to the next box, to the right. And you keep doing this until you've put all the cards in the box on the right. Okay?

          So even if you had trouble, you keep putting it back in the stack until you've promoted it to the next box. Okay? The following day, you take these same ten cards, and you test yourself. If you know it again, after a day, you put it into the next box. If you forgot it, it goes back to this box. And the cycle continues. So the more that you know the cards, the more it gets promoted to the next box, and if you forget, it goes backwards.

          So the idea is, you concentrate more often on the cards you don't know. And the cards you do know, or you've tested correctly get reviewed less often. And this area represents your long-term memory, where this area represents now.

          And with Mnemosyne, you input lists into the software,and the computer does the scheduling for you. So you rate the cards. And if you know it, it goes up. And if you don't know it, it goes back to the beginning. Until you can successfully remember what the flashcards are.

          That's the basis of how it works. And in other videos, I'm going to show how to download the software, put it on a USB stick, force the UI to English in case you different OSes with different languages. I'll show how to create your own content. I'll show how to take content that's already available and import it into Mnemosyne. And, uh, I'll show some other tricks if I have time.

          Okay. That's it. I hope you watch the other videos.

          Okay. In this video, I'm going to show how to download and install Mnemosyne project software onto a USB stick, or portable hard drive. I use this software to study Japanese, but you can use it, um, for anything, anything where you have a question and an answer, and you want to memorize.

          So, just into Google, I'm going to type, "Mnemosyne project," and it's an open-source software source. Uh, so it's free. And it's developed actively, by the developer. It's absolutely great. It's the only way to study Japanese in my opinion.

          You go to the Download link. I'm going to choose the setup.exe. Here is the Intel Mac version, and the Linux version. But I want this one here, 32-bit Windows, because I'm on Windows XP.

          Okay. And I'm going to save the file to my portable hard drive. In my case, it's G:. In your case, it's probably different. But download it to your USB stick. Well, it's fast. 

          So here's the file that I downloaded. Double-click. Click Run. And follow the options. I'm going to install it onto my G: drive. Finished.

          The next step. So let's look on the website. Here under Documentation, Advanced Features, it says, Running from a USB drive. Okay? It gives the instructions here. And it says, it's usually in C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>\ et cetera. Okay?

          So you want to find the .Mnemosyne directory. So, so my computer's name is Start. So, I"m just going to go, MyComputer, C:, Documents and Settings, Start, and they'll see Mnemosyne folder. Okay?

          And here is my portable hard drive. So my desktop, my portable hard drive. I'm going to open the Mnemosyne folder. And all I'm going to do is Control-C to copy, Control-V to paste. And there it is. Done.

          So that's how you install, um, Mnemosyne onto a USB stick. So the first time you run it, you want to choose this file, right here, Mnemosyne.exe. Okay? Some computers, it might not show the .exe. And that's because in the Folder Options, under View, you might have this checked, Hide extensions for known file types. If that's the case, .exe doesn't show up. I always in the Tools Folder options, under View, I always uncheck this, because I want to know what the extension is.

          That's a little bit confusing for some people. So, if you don't see the .exe, that's the reason why. And to start up the software, just Double-click. And this is, Mnemosyne. It doesn't look like much now, but this is probably the best way to learn languages, anything you want to memorize. It's absolutely amazing. All right. That's just the first step. Okay, that's it.

          After you've installed Anki on your computer, you can download Shared Decks by opening the program, and then going down to the bottom left button, here, Get Shared, and clicking on it. When we click on it, it will take us to a list of shared decks in your web browser. Over here, we can see some popular categories. So if we click on Japanese, for example, it will show us a list of all the Japanese-related decks that have been uploaded.

          So, as a little sample today, let's study some state capitals. So, I'll go to the Geography section. Or I could type in a search here instead. And we've got some different choices here. I'm going to choose a simple one. Which has just 50 state capitals. And no audio and no images.

          So to download this and put it into Anki, all I have to do is click Info, and then go down here and click the Download button. And you can see above here, we have a preview of the content that will appear when we study.

          And this particular deck is quite simple. But if we look at other decks, we have got ones with images, some of them will include sounds. And, so on.

          So, let's go back to the State Capitals, and click Download. And we'll save it to our computer. And once it's downloaded, all we have to do is doubleclick on it, and it should be automatically loaded into Anki. 50 cards imported. OK. So, we close this, and we can see that a deck has appeared here. It's telling us that we have 20 new cards to study today. By default, Anki will introduce 20 cards per day, so that you don't get over-run with reviews in the future. You can customize this number if you'd like to.

          So, let's have a look. Let's click on this deck. And we're presented with an overview screen here. And you can see here that it tells us that we've got 20 New cards. And we've got zero Learning and Review cards.

          So, let's just jump into studying for now. We click the Study Now button. And we're presented with a question here. We're studying state capitals here, so I have to think of the capital city of Alabama. And I believe the answer is Montgomery. So, once I've thought about the answer, and I've decided, OK, I know this, and I've said it to myself, I go down here and I click the Show Answer button, to see if I'm correct or not. And you will see that you can also press the Space Bar on your keyboard if you want to do that. So, I'll click for now. And you can see that the answer is Montgomery. So I was correct.

          Now I have three choices down the bottom, Again, Good and Easy. If I forgot, or if I didn't know the answer to this card, I would click Again, and the card would be shown to me again. in less than a minute, so that I'm reminded quickly and I have a chance to actually learn this and remember it. If I did know the answer, but I'd like to test myself again in a little while, I can click good, and the card will be shown to me again within ten minutes, depending on how many other cards you have to study. And if I thought, This is easy, I don't need to review this again for a while, I can click Easy, and it will be shown to me again in four days.

          So, I think I remembered this reasonably well, but I'd like to practice again in ten minues, so I'll press the Good button. And again, if you hover over, you can see there's a shortcut key, One, Two, Three. So, I think I'm good here.

          OK. Alaska, I think was Juneau. Let's show the answer, press the Space Bar this time. Juneau, OK, I was correct. And again, I'd like to practice again in ten minutes, so I will choose Good here. I can either press Number Two, or I can also press the Space key. You can see that this button is actually going [..] blue border. [..] this is the default answer. This is the answer that Anki is recommending you choose if you knew it. So I'll just press the Space Bar again.

          OK, Arizona, I don't remember the answer to this one, so I'm going to just click Show Answer. And I find out that the answer is Phoenix. OK. In this case, because I didn't know it. I'm going to choose Again, instead of Good. And when I do that, Anki will show it to us again in one minute. And then, if we get it right, one minute later, then we'll see it again in ten minutes.

          So we're making two steps, one-minute step, then a ten-minute step. So, if I choose Again, notice the count has gone to four. Previously, it was two. So half of that count is that card we forgot.

          OK. Let's do a couple more. Arkansas. I don't remember this one either. So, let's show the answer. Little Rock. OK. So, I'm going to choose Again. But this time, I'll use my keyboard. I'll press One, which is a shortcut for Again.

          And Arizona. Here's our .. Notice that the number here is underlined. The little underline indicates that the currently displayed card is a Learning card, rather than a New card or a Review card. So this Arizona one, we will .. we answered a couple of minutes ago. And we're now being asked on it again. So, I think it was Phoenix. Let's give this a try. Yes, I was correct. OK. So this time I did remember. So, I'm going to choose Good, rather than Again.

          California is, Sacramento. OK. Good. And you can continue like this until your cards, the count down the bottom, reaches zero. You don't have to study until zero, if you don't have time. If you'd like to stop, you can simply close the program. Or click Decks to return to the list of decks here.

          And one other thing to notice is that by default, we have a limit of twenty New cards and a limit of 100 Reviews. So that if you go on a holiday or something, you're not confronted with a huge list of cards to review again.

          If you want to change these limits, all you need to do is click the Options button. And then you can configure the number of New cards per day. For example, the amount of delay between when you forget a card, which is one minute and the next step, which is ten. You can give yourself more steps if you want to. You can have steps of hours. Well, that's totally configurable.

          And the review section, you can configure the Maximum reviews a day.

          One other thing I should point out. If you look at the top of this screen, there's an Options group section. And, by default, all of the decks that you import or add will share the same set of options. So that, when you change the options, the options will change for every deck. 

          If you'd like to have some decks with different options, for example, if you'd like to study more German cards than you are studying your computing cards, on the top right, you can click that button, and it will allow you to create a new Option group and then you can tell each deck which Option group you want to use.
