    Kevin and Carla are at the zoo. They see polar bears and zebras first. Next, they go to the aquarium. They see a shark. It swims close to the glass. The shark opens its mouth. It has so many teeth! Carla screams. She's afraid of the shark. A man feeds the shark, and it swims away. "Don't be afraid. The shark is gone," Kevin says.

    G: Look at the polar bears!
    B: Yeah, they're playing in the water. Which animals do you like best?
    G: I like monkeys. They are cute. What about you?
    B: I like lions.
    G: I don't like lions. They have big claws and teeth. They roar a lot, too.
    B: Oh, well, that's why I like them.

    Many zoos have polar bears. Sometimes, zoos are too warm for polar bears. Why is this? Polar bears live in cold places. They like snow and ice. There is no snow at the zoo. So, zookeepers make snow for them. Snow helps keep the bears cool.
