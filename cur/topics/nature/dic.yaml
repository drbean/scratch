    There are many forests in North America. There are many trees in these forests. Some of these trees are more than two hundred feet tall. Some are over five hundred years old.
    Several kinds of trees grow in these forests. Fir, cedar and pine are three. These trees grow in different areas. Some grow in forests. Some grow on mountains. People who lived in this place long ago used these trees to make things out of wood.
    Many of these trees are now in special areas. These areas are called forest reserves or national parks.
    Some parks charge a small entrance fee. Visitors must pay the entrance fee to enter the parks. Then they can walk among the beautiful old trees. They must take care not to damage the trees. We should all take care of forests.
