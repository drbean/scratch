Commentary: On November 26, 1946, one of the coldest days of the year, 1,165 teachers from Saint Paul, Minnesota went out on strike. 
Murphy: And it seemed as if the Board of Education was holding the line to such a degree that they were forced to go out on the streets and to a strike. But they were also looking forward to kind of breaking that barrier to negotiating, so that they could move from a kind of moral suasion that had been the, the central way in which school teachers had bargained before to collective bargaining, as was known in the new labor movement that had grown in the 1930s. 
Commentary: The strike which lasted nearly six weeks, was the first organized teachers' strike in the country. A startled nation realized that teachers were now willing to use strike as a weapon to fight for better funding and better schools.
