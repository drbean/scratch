1:25 Sarah: After all, when you think about it, the fashion runways and the
freshman hallways aren't that different.

Kerry: It's true.

Sarah: It's all about taking risks and strutting your stuff.

Kerry: And knowing if you trip and fall, you're not going to ruin your couture.
Or better yet, your academic reputation.

Sarah: You know, ???. Less is not always more. I mean, when I first started and
I was a fashion fledgling, I only went to one, maybe two, fashion shows a year.
And I'm telling you, that just wasn't enough to know what's hot and what's not.

Kerry: That's so true. And, when students are given just a few summative tests
a year, it's a very limited view. It doesn't really accurately display what's
really going on in the classroom, or reflect what teachers are teaching.

Commentary: When it comes to testing, how often is desirable?

Excessive testing gets students focused on, "How well am I doing," instead of
"What am I learning?". 

Address whether the time spent testing is disproportionate to the
time spent learning.

More testing also creates a focus on short-term memory instead of long-term
memory and actual understanding. 

And reevaluate exam frequency for younger learners, including timed tests.

Kerry: I think the key message here is balance. Too much perfume, accessories
or assessments, uhm, becomes overdone, unnecessary, loses its cachet.  Sarah:
And too little leaves no lasting impression at all.
