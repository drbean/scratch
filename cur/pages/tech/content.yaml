title: Technical English
blurb: |+
         <p>
         Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
         English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

         <br>
         Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think  it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food   and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.                                 

         <br>
         I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning      English.

    intro: Part of the problem studying at a university in English is the vocabulary. You have to understand words which most native speakers never use but which are necessary to read textbooks or to listen to profs lecture.

        blurb: |
          We studied 180 words from the Academic Wordlist, but it is better to study words you want to learn, rather than someone else wants you learn. Make a deck of cards of words you want to study and upload them to Mnemosyne or Anki so other people can study them also.
        comment: |
          Creating the deck of cards. Make 10 or more cards.
