    Joey: Thanks, you're the best. Now listen. The last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I've got to get in there by Thursday. Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
    Chandler: Yes. So, Tuesday?
    Joey: Thursday. Look. If you need help for a moment, think of it like this. The third day. All right? Monday? One day. Tuesday? Two day. Wednesday? When? Huh? What day? Thursday. The third day. Okay?
    Chandler: Thank you.
    Joey. Okay.
    
    Chandler: Hey.
    Joey: Hey
    So
    Chandler: It's Thursday. How was the audition?
    Joey: Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when Thursday? Oh! Oh!

    Joey: Well that thing's clearly in the way. Right. Aha! Aaah!
    Chandler: Well, yuh. You don't look good, Joe.
    Joey: The fridge broke. So I had to eat everything. Cold cuts. Ice cream. Limes. Hey. What was in that brown jar?
    Chandler: That still in there?
    Joey: Not any more. So, anyway. How do you want to pay me?
    Chandler: Is this a service you're providing me?

   Joey: No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!

   Chandler: Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.

   Joey: So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.

   Chandler: Uh-huh.

   Joey: And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies
   and-and I gotta buy a new kid.

   Chandler: (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried)
   Okay…

   Joey: (pause) Give me $400!

   Ross: You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a
   trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this!
   Okay? What-what do I tell her?

   Chandler: Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.

   Ross: I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?

   Chandler: Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

   Joey: Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in Ross’s
   ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)

   Ross: What the hell are you doing?

   Joey: What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!

   Ross: What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!

   Joey: Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse
   me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know!
   Broken! That’ll be $400!

    Paul: Relax. Relax, Paul. You're doing great. She likes you. She likes you. You know why? Because you're a .. neat guy. You are the man. You are the man. You are .. The Man. Still got it. Still sexy. Just a love machine. I'm just a love machine.

    Chandler: And you don't have a mustache. Which is good. I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
    Richard: Oh, I'm sorry, Lisa. Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
    Chandler: Richard. No one's supposed to know about us. See? I did it again.

    Ross: Wow. I have never had such a healthy break-up. She was such a grownup about it. She didn't seem too immature for me. Did I just make a huge mistake?
    Elizabeth: Ross. Wait.
    Ross: Elizabeth. I was just thinking about ...
    Elizabeth: You suck. 
    Ross: What? Okay. Break-up's still on.

    Chandler: Monica, will you marry me?
    Monica: Yes.
    Monica: I knew you were likely to take a wife.
    Joey: 
    Monica: Come in, come in. We're engaged.
    Rachel: This is the least jealous I've ever been.
    Phoebe: Oh, no! Wait, this is wrong. Ross isn't here.
    Rachel: Oh, hell. He's done this three times. He knows what it's about.
