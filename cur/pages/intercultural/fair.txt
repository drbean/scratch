00:49 Dan Stein: I thought it would be good for Julie to tell us a little about what's going on and what Senator Durbin is doing in response to the overwhelming outpouring of calls, faxes and emails that are coming from the American people. How are you doing?
01:01 Julie Kirchner: Hi, Dan. I'm doing just fine, thank you. 
01:03 Dan Stein: Hi, what's going on?
01:05 Julie Kirchner: Well, we've seen a new development happen today. Um, Senator Durbin, apparently has been under a lot of pressure. Your phone calls have made a huge difference. We hear from offices they're getting thousands and thousands and thousands of calls. And overwhelmingly, these calls are opposed to the DREAM Act.

And what's happened today is Senator Durbin has introduced a new amendment. He's redrafted the DREAM Act amendment. And he clearly is retreating. He knows he's having trouble getting support. And he's cutting out bits and pieces. He's trying to, you know, tweak the language a little bit to make it look better in order to get more people to sign on. 

01:43 Dan Stein: Basically you're saying the calls and faxes and ... are working.
01:45 Julie Kirchner: Oh, they're absolutely working.
01:47 Dan STein: He's hitting a wall of opposition. 
01:50 Julie Kirchner: Oh, yeh, absolutely. We had a call from a senator's office today, a staffer who said, uh, FAIR, you need to know that we're a definite No, because our office is getting inundated. Please stop them from calling. 
02:01 Dan Stein: The people need to keep it up, right?
02:02 Julie Kirchner: They need to keep it up. The ... Everyone needs pressure. And, and you need to tell your senators that you will not be fooled by drafts and redrafts and tinkering. It's still the DREAM Act. It's still an amnesty. And we can't be rewarding um, illegal activity.
