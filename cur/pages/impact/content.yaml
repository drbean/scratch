          What should we do for the environment? Should we stop riding cars, which cause air pollution, and using air conditioners, which contribute to global warming? That is drastic action. Should the government increase taxes on environmentally-destructive activities? Should all countries agree to limit pollution?

          Does Taipei have a traffic problem? Does Miaoli have one? Taiwanese roads are not good for driving on. But even countries with good roads, like the US, have traffic problems. What do you think should be done to make the roads better? Although motor scooters use less energy than cars, I think they are a problem. More people in Taiwan should ride bicycles.

          What is the Taiwan government doing about population control? Years ago, families were encouraged to have fewer children. Now there are not enough children being born. What should the government do? Do you believe the government should order families to have children (or to not have children, in the case of mainland China)?

He uses these words: aging societies, population control, fines for childless couples, striking the right balance between advising and regulating, and not going overboard.

Studying finance at Rutgers University, she was treated meanly and unfairly by a teacher, and at her first job interview, the boss used offensive language with her. She also had to make tough decisions about her children, her marriage and her career. She wanted to give 100 percent to all three. But that was not possible.
        comment: |
          She says that things were not good in the 1970's when she was young. But she says men still think the same. The only difference is that they are more careful about how they express themselves, ie they are more subtle.
