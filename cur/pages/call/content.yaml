title: Computer and Multimedia-Assisted Language Teaching
blurb: |+
         <p>
         This course is about using the computer and multimedia to learn English.
         <br>
         Dr Bean thinks when we talk about the computer and multimedia we can talk indirectly about learning, something which is difficult to do directly.

    title: Using the computer to sequence flash cards
    intro: Flash cards are/were small cards with a word on one side and the translation on the other. Nowadays the computer is used to space repetition of forgotten words more frequently and remembered words less frequently. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard</a>.

                Listen to a Mnemosyne user <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p1WDb5f_ro">explain what Mnemosyne is</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBowB3lpV3k">how to install it on your computer.</a>
        comment: Dr Bean is going to ask students to try learning with this software and another free, open-source flashcard app, <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>, Week 5-8. So try installing them yourself now.

        comment: Dr Bean is going to ask students to upload flashcard decks to the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">Anki shared deck web site</a> and <a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/card-sets">Mnemosyne card set web site</a>,  Week 5-8.

        title: Baseline for learning of Academic Word List sublists 1-3
        blurb: |
          We now will learn the 180 words from the first 3 Academic Wordlist sublists for the midterm exam, using <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> or <a href="http://mnemosyne-project.org">Mnemosyne</a>, or <a href="http://memrise.com">Memrise</a>. But first we need to establish what the base level is.
        comment: To do this, we will guess the meanings (in Chinese) of the words, or if we know them, just write them in.

          Having learned the 180 words from the first 3 Academic Wordlist sublists for the midterm exam, using Anki or Mnemosyne, Now we need to establish how many words you know.

        title: Upload your deck of cards to Mnemosyne or Anki
        blurb: |
          We studied 180 words from the Academic Wordlist, but it is better to study words you want to learn, rather than someone else wants you learn. Make a deck of cards of words you want to study and upload them to Mnemosyne or Anki so other people can study them also.
        comment: |
          Creating the deck of cards. Make 10 or more cards.

        title: Questions, Answers about self-introductions
        blurb: |
          <b>Now make questions about Betty, Bruce2, Emily2, Jeremy, May, Oliver, Roger, Silva, </b>. Although it is more natural for questions about the members of the class ("Who has a cat") to be in present tense, all questions must be in past tense ("Who had a cat") and they must only use the words from the list. If something was not mentioned in the video, then it can be assumed that answers to questions about that thing are No. So, the answer to ("Dr Bean didn't have a mother, did he?") is "No. He didn't." Many students didn't talk about their families in their videos, so they didn't have families.

        comment: I don't have the resources of IBM. This is all my own work. So you are going to find problems with the app. Some of your grammatical questions will be evaluated as ungrammatical. Some of your questions with correct answers will be evaluated as having the wrong answers. If the answer is wrong to a question like, "Did the man who was a teacher want to work in Hsinchu," for example, (if it is "No," not "Yes," for example), then please contact me by using the web form on the app.
