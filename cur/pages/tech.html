<h2><a name=tech>Technical English</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

<br>
Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think  it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food   and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.                                 

<br>
I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning      English.

<p>
Part of the problem studying at a university in English is the vocabulary. You have to understand words which most native speakers never use but which are necessary to read textbooks or to listen to profs lecture.

<h4><a name=travel-test>Test for learning of 120 travel words from Vam, Winny, Nini, Camuel</a></h4>
<p>
We learned the 120 words from 4 students, using <a href="http://ankisrs.n, or <a href="http://memrise.com">Memrise</a>.

</p>
<p>
Write, or guess the meanings (in Chinese) of the words.
</p>
<p>
Fill in the blanks in the <a 
href=http://210.60.168.195/cgi-bin/aca/script/aca_fastcgi.pl/login?exercise=travel-test>travel-test</a> exercise. (You will be asked to log in.)

<h2>Old Exercises</h2>
</p>

<p>
Can't find an exercise you didn't finish in a previous week? You can't do that exercise now for credit. But you may be able to find it on the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Access.html#tech>Self-access</a> page.

<h2><a name="login"> Logging in </a></h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is any name you want to use. English is good, Chinese is OK too. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first (second?) Chinese name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the Hanyu Pinyin (漢語拼音) spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
</ul>
