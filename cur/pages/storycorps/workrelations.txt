Ed Trinka has now stopped working at the Plaza. He is sixty-five. He worked there for forty-six years. His father also worked at the Plaza Hotel and he got Ed the job as doorman. The employees made a lot of the decisions about who could work at the hotel. If your relatives worked at the hotel, it was easier to get a job there.

Managers found it very difficult to control the doormen and other staff at the hotel. The staff didn't listen to the managers. Shane, the general manager told Ed to treat everyone like a VIP, but Ed didn't really listen to Shane. He told Shane I already do treat everyone like a VIP.

Fortunately, Ed was very popular with the guests at the Plaza, a very expensive and famous old hotel. All the guests had lots of money. And many of them were famous and important. They really were VIPs.

Ed stopped working for the Plaza for a while because he didn't like Shane telling him what to do. But when Shane asked him to come back to the Plaza Hotel, he returned. Ed said he never had a bad day working at the hotel, but that may not really be true. One thing that made Ed unhappy was the death of his wife, who was working at the hotel too. Now he is looking for a new wife.
