I was making my way across the state of Arkansas in July and August, the hottest months, getting parents to sign petitions to get their local school integrated. I was supposed to speak to the branch. (You always had to speak to the units.) So I wanted to take a bath. And there was a tin tub. It was about two feet deep and er, wide enough to wash clothing in. That's what the tub was intended.

Anyway, I decided that I wanted to sit down and get the water over me, because I was hot and dusty. But then I couldn't push myself up from the tub. I was just stuck. So, I called my host and she could not get me from the tub. So she went out and conferred. And they decided that they would take me into the back yard, so they could pour the water from the tub.

The back yard had a wire fence and people were walking along the sidewalk and they stopped to watch this, this spectacle. Eventually, they were able to pull me up out of the tub. Then people applauded. And, and they put something over me. And I went back into the house.

That night, at the meeting, I was introduced by the branch president. And I approached the podium, and someone in the audience arose and he said, You know, Mr President, we have already met Ms Bond. We saw her earlier today. And, uh, she looks as good in clothing as she did with none on.
