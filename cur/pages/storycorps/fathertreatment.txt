Charles Jackson didn't really have a happy family life after his mother, Lotte got Alzheimer's disease. At first Jack, his father, and Lotte, argued a lot. Before he realized Lotte had Alzheimer's, Jack thought Lotte was being careless and stupid. This made him very angry with her. When Jack started shouting at Lotte, Lotte would started shouting back at him. Gradually Jack realized that Lotte's behavior wasn't under her control. But this didn't make him any happier. He was very unhappy that his wife was slowly losing her mind. All this made Charles, his brother, and especially his mother, unhappy too.

Charles father and his brother gradually started spending as little time at home as they could. Charles' father told him it was his job to look after his mother and before he went to school in the morning and after he came home from school, he had to feed her and help her go to the bathroom.

When he got home in the afternoon, he would always find Lotte sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket around her and the blinds pulled down. She was so unhappy that she asked Charles to help her die. Charles couldn't agree to do that.

Later she became unable to walk. But before that she started trying to run away. She would leave the house and just walk away from the house with no idea of where she was going or what she was looking for. Charles used to lock the door to prevent her leaving, but she would try to jump out the window, or she would leave the house when Jack wasn't looking.
