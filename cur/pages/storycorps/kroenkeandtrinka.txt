Both of Ron and Ed's stories are about men at work, but the interest of the stories is in relationships they have with other people.

Even though Ron is trying his best to do a good job, he makes the old people at the nursing home unhappy. This upsets him too. Everyone is unhappy. But one of the people at the home, Rose, comes up to him and thanks him. Rose is unhappy too that there will be no concert, but she doesn't want Ron to feel bad about that fact. So she thanks him for doing a good job. This is different than the behavior of the angry woman, who attacks Ron.

Ron is a nice person and Rose is a nice person, but the angry woman isn't a nice person.

Ed's story is a happier story. But it is not as touching as Ron's story. Ed's job was as a doorman. He had to help people get out of their cars and into the hotel. But really his job was to make people feel good about staying at the hotel.

He was good at this because he enjoyed life himself and he enjoyed interacting with people. Some of the people he met were less happy than him. But he made them feel happy. This is why he was a great guy and very popular.
