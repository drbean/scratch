In 1944, my brother Joe was in the service. Of course, he was fighting in Germany. A telegram came saying that he was missing in action.
And so, I was afraid to tell my parents and I ran to get my three sisters who were at church. And I said you have to come home, Momma and Papa need you.
We were so upset, my sister, instead of getting in the car, she ran home, ran all the way home alongside the car. It was the worst news you could get. It was getting closer to Christmas and Mother says, We won't be able to have a Christmas tree this year, because Joey's not here. We don't know if he is alive. We don't know anything. So we're going to not have a Christmas tree.
And then Christmas Eve, a letter came from Joey. I'm in a hospital, I'm all right, I'll come home soon, and by now you must be putting up the Christmas tree.
And my mother says, Oh, look what happened. He's telling us to decorate the tree.
And my brother John, he says: Mom, guess what? Last night when I came home from work, I got a Christmas tree, and I put it under the porch, because I thought maybe you would change your mind and we could have the Christmas tree.
So we put it up and decorated it. This one's for you Joe.
And it turned out nice.
