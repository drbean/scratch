Letting go for my mother was scary. And she would say, Yes, she would go, one day. And, No, she wouldn't go the next. And so I called the mother of my best friend. And I said, What do I do? And she said, Mothers can never resist their children, when their children simply bare their hearts. So don't go in and try to be strong for your mom. Don't go in making her try to do anything. Just look your mom in the eye. And tell her you need her help. In order for you to help her. 

And I did. She looked back at me. And she said, I will go, though I'm so scared. I will go. And I put my head in her lap. And I cried, but she didn't. She put her hand under her chin, like she does. And she just looked off to the side.

And then when I got done crying, she said, Well, we'd better go do this before I change my mind.
