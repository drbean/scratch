The interview was recorded for the <a href="http://wsjdigitalsolutions.com/">The Wall Street Journal Digital Network</a>, run by his own newspaper, so the interviewer asks no embarrassing questions about phone hacking and Wendi. He only says a little bit about his problems in England. It is mostly about the unprofitability of newspapers.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Reilly_(political_commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera">Geraldo Rivera</a> are news show hosts on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a> cable and satellite TV news channel owned by Rupert Murdoch. Fox News is extremely popular with conservative Americans, and extremely unpopular with liberal leftists, the White House and other Democrats.
        comment: |
          Listen to Rivera and O'Reilly argue about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3U9ENaTPLY">an illegal alien who killed a woman while driving drunk.</a> O'Reilly said the man should be deported to Mexico. Rivera was angry with the way O'Reilly reported the story. He said it was a drunk driving story, not an illegal alien story. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States">Illegal aliens in the US</a> is a controversial topic there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs">Lou Dobbs</a>, another news caster who Rivera criticizes for being very opposed to illegal immigration, now also works for Fox News.
          <p>
          As for O'Reilly and Rivera's relationship, look at them discussing <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/03/10/OReilly%20Rivera%20Spar%20Over%20Obama%20Bell%20Relationship">an old clip of Obama in law school</a>. I think you will see that they like each other, and that perhaps their earlier argument was not a real argument, but an argument staged for the viewers' benefit.

          Besides live sports broadcasts, it also airs a variety of sports highlight, talk and documentary style shows. Watch clips from three shows. The first, published in its <a href="http://espn.go.com/magazine">ESPN Magazine</a>, at <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8677775/the-truth-houston-rockets-guards-james-harden-jeremy-lin-espn-magazine">True and False by Jeremy Lin and Jamese Harden</a> is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPAxGHf5LdA">here</a>. The second, an interview with a Mixed Martial Arts fighter, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335796/chael-sonnen">Chael Sonnen</a> is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ARxky0Qv4">here</a>. The third, highlights of a match in the playoff series between the Chicago Bulls and Brooklyn Nets is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRAYKwrfPJ4">here</a>. If the last link is broken, download the mp4 file <a href="http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/media/bulls-nets.mp4">here</a>, the mp3 file <a href="http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/media/bulls-nets.mp3">here</a> and the ogg file <a href="http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/media/bulls-nets.ogg">here</a>.

        blurb: |
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio">Campus radio stations</a> in the US are of various sorts. Listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcWfHy_LSs">an introduction to one</a> run to teach students about radio. Others like <a href="http://vu.wsum.wisc.edu/wsumlive.m3u">this one</a>, the students are more in control, but are perhaps not as professional.
        comment: Students also produce newspapers, like the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com">Harvard Crimson</a>. These newspapers are now moving online, and are being read less. They also are producing videos. Listen to a Harvard Crimson video about a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sebQ-Q6TbO4"> Harvard center for women</a>.
