	"While William Kendall was at the New Covent Garden Soup Company, the company started marketing organic soups, soups made from vegetables grown without any farm chemicals, in addition to soups made from ordinary materials treated with farm chemicals.

These organic soups were very popular. Kendall realized that lots of people wanted to eat food that was organic and made from natural, unpolluted ingredients. He stopped using farm chemicals on his own farm and with the money he made selling his share of the New Covent Garden Soup Company he bought Green and Black Chocolate from Craig Sams, a very strong supporter of organic foods. Green and Black Chocolate was completely organic. It had no farm chemicals.

Green and Black Chocolate was very popular with people who only ate organic foods. But Kendall could see that everyone was concerned about healthy food and he believed that Green and Black would become more and more popular in the future.

William Kendall didn't believe in organic foods when he was young. But he saw the success of organic soups and Green and Black Chocolate and that interested him. He realized that people wanted to be connected to the food they eat. They wanted to know about the food they eat. They wanted to have a personal relationship with the food they eat and the people who grow it.

When he took over Green and Black, the company had sales of two million pounds. When the company was sold to a very big chocolate company, six years later, it had sales of twenty-two million pounds.
