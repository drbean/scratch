You are Charles, the chief executive of a camping equipment company in France. Jacques is your production manager. He is responsible for making the tents and other equipment that your company sells. Todd is your marketing manager. He is responsible for selling your products. The marketing department is very successful, partly because Oliver, one of Todd's sales representatives is a very good salesman. You like both Oliver and Todd. But Oliver and Todd are fighting. You agree Oliver is a difficult employee, but you have been friends with him for years. He is very valuable to the company. You'd like to keep Oliver happy if possible, and to find ways to deal with the situation. The sales from his area amount to twenty-four percent of the business's total sales.

Oliver: I've been thinking a lot recently, Todd. I think you probably know, I'm not happy here at all. And I feel I've got to do something about it.
Todd: Really? What exactly is the problem?
Oliver: I think you know it, Todd. Jacques let me down badly with that order. He just wouldn't make any effort for me, so we've lost the order. It means I don't get the commission, and it'll also affect my bonus.
Todd: Oliver, you must understand. You can't promise a customer that we'll deliver in three weeks. It's a busy time at the moment. Jacques's working under a lot of pressure.
Oliver: Maybe, but let's face it. Jacques's no good as a production manager. He can't deal with pressure. He just says, Sorry I can't help. But it's not just Jacques..
Todd: Oh yes?
Oliver: Well, to be honest, I'm not happy with the way you run the department.

Oliver: Well, to be honest, I'm not happy with the way you run the department.
Todd: I'm listening.
Oliver: The trouble with you is, you always want to know where I am, every second of the day. You give me no space. You want to control me all the time. How can I meet my sales targets if I have to spend all the time writing reports, answering your telephone messages and attending meetings? I've got to be out there selling, twenty-four hours every day.
Todd: Maybe, but you can't just do what you like, when you like, Oliver. Discipline is important.
Oliver: Discipline! Control! Look, I've had enough. I've give everything to this company. But no one cares. So, I've decided to resign. You'll get my letter in the morning and I'll send a copy to Charles. He won't be pleased, I'm sure. We've been friends for years. But I just can't work with you Todd. There's no other solution.

You are Todd, the marketing manager of the camping equipment company. Oliver is a very good salesman. But he doesn't listen to you. You want Charles to punish Oliver. You tell Charles that Oliver spends too much money on entertainment and expensive gifts for his customers. He also has not introduced you to the biggest buyers in his area. He says the buyers are too busy to meet you. But you think his plan is to leave the company, join a different company and get the buyers to switch to his new company's products. You want to meet the buyers to make sure that Charles doesn't take his buyers with him. Oliver also ignores your phone messages and does not write sales reports.
