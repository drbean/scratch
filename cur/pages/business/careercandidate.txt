First, we looked at ways to think about your career. For example, is it important to talk much with the boss about our dreams and ambitions? Should we get together with people in other parts of the company? Next we compared three candidates for a new sales manager position. We had to think whether the candidate would be a good leader and good administrator.

What is the relationship between these two exercises? The issues are ones that you face together when you think about your position and decide it is not satisfying.

Companies want new employees who have thought about their career and who have tried to improve it. However in interviews, it is difficult for both interviewer and interviewee to talk about this. Our mental lives are private.

Sometimes the best candidate will fail to get the job, and a weaker candidate will be chosen. But it is our inner self which finally determines what kind of career we have, rather than the people or society around us.
