Try to better yourself all the time. There is always some skill you can learn for your job and how to do it better. If the company offers you training, take the training. You can study too, part-time at colleges in the evening or weekend, and by reading. Be a life-long learner.

Talk to your boss. Let management know what you think. If you want something, ask for it. They may not give it to you, but perhaps they will negotiate with you for something less. A raise which is smaller than you wanted is better than no raise at all.

What's important, I think, is to think about what you are doing. What you think while you are working is as important as what you do. Don't think about the weekend when you are at work. Think about what you are doing at that moment. How could you do it better? What is the purpose of what you are doing? Understand what you are doing.
