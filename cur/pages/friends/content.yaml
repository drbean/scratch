title: Friends--American TV sitcom
blurb: |+
         <p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends>Friends</a> was an American sitcom, which ran from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004. 
         <br>
         It was, and is still, <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/> very popular</a>.
         <br>
         A lot of the language is simple, although it may be fast. Anyway, it is suitable for people learning English. At the same time, it is funny, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

        comment: Why? Does he like the people there and feel embarrassed about disappointing them? Is he afraid that he will change his mind and continue to belong to the gym? Is he afraid that the people at the gym will be angry and try to humiliate him or even physically abuse him?

          Ross is trying to date Elizabeth, his student, but Elizabeth's father, Paul, who is dating Rachel, says he will get him fired until Ross threatens to reveals Paul's self-identification as Rachel's 'love machine.' Meanwhile Joey misses an audition and breaks his fridge. He asks Chandler and Ross to pay for a new one.

       title: Season 7, Episode 1. Rachel upset by Monica's engagement
       blurb: |
         At the end of the 6th season, Chandler and Monica got engaged. The seventh season is about preparation for the wedding. In the first show of the 7th season, Rachel feels romantic as a result of the engagement, and suggests to Ross they go to bed together. But Monica is mad with Rachel for wanting to go to bed with Ross. Monica and Rachel fight and then make up. Ross is the big loser.
       comment: Watch at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TskSEcpBRmY">Best of Ross</a>. Monica thinks Rachel was trying to <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/steal+thunder">steal her thunder</a> or <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/upstage">upstage</a> her.

       blurb: |
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weddings">Weddings </a> are composed of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_vows">vows</a>, rings (in the West), and a proclamation or pronouncement of marriage by an authority figure, here, Joey.
       comment: But someone is pregnant, and it doesn't appear to be Monica, because Monica didn't take a pregnancy test. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRPd3oOScuo">Edited version of Season 7. Episode 24</a>. It doesn't have the dialog of the second half of the exercise, which is about the pregnancy test Phoebe found in the trash. Try to fill in the blanks anyway.

        title: TOW with the Male Nanny
        blurb: |
          <h2>No new homework in Week 14</h2>Ross is not comfortable with sensitive men. So he fires the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO_vyzgLcYw">male nanny</a>.
        comment: American men wear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeveless_shirt">tank top</a> while playing sport, but at other times, usually it is worn by women. That is why Ross's father didn't want him to wear it.
