00:00 But in Taiwan, a special, like, celebration thing is the barbecue.
00:04 People, like, ...
00:06 Okay, what I mean barbecue, I actually mean, like grilling.
00:09 Because they don't really cook the food for a long time, and cover it.
00:12 They just put the meat over the grill thing.
00:16 The metal grill plate thing.
00:17 And then, like, grill, grill, grill, for, like, a few minutes.
00:21 Like, a couple of minutes.
00:22 And then take it out.
00:23 And most of the meat are, like, on skewers.
00:25 You know, not like hamburger meat, or like lamb chops.
00:28 But like little, like, sausages, like Chinese sausages.
00:32 Uh, I don't know if you guys have seen Chinese sausages.
00:35 But, anyway, they're like fat little fellows.
00:37 And, you know, like,
00:38 Uh and then, what else do people grill here during Moon Festival.
00:42 Um, also like little things called kim[1]bu[3]lai[4].
00:45 I think it's some kind of fish paste that was, like, um.
00:48 I mean, it was, like, made into a solid form from fish paste, whatever.
00:53 Anyway, they just, like, grill these little things,
00:55 that usu, usu, usually, like, stuff that you see in the night market.
00:58 Just little things.
00:59 Or, like green peppers, or, um,
01:02 Or perhaps mushrooms, and sausages, and little bits of meat.
01:06 Um, stuff on skewers.
01:07 Just simple stuff.
