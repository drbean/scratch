    M: Do you know those people?
    F: What people?
    M: The ones waving at us.
    F: Oh, those are my parents.
    Q: Who is waving to the girl and boy?

    M: Are your sisters in the same department?
    F: Yes. They are both law students.
    M: That's cool!
    F: Yeah. They both want to be lawyers.
    Q: How many sisters does the woman have?

    M: Look, Lisa is here.
    F: I didn't know she was coming.
    M: Of course. She's quite a popular girl.
    F: Oh, I guess you're right.
    Q: What does the man say about Lisa?

    F: Are you busy tonight?
    M: No. Do you want to watch a movie?
    F: Sure. I'll let you choose it.
    M: Sounds great.
    Q: What does the woman tell the man?

    M: Today is my first day at my new job.

    M: It's in tourism.
    F: Oh, tell me more.
    Q: What work does the man do?

    F: You look a little tired today.
    M: Yes, I am. Where's the coffee?
    F: Over there. Did you sleep last night?
    M: No, I was under too much stress.
    Q: Why didn't the man get any sleep?

    F: The movie starts soon.
    M: What time is it?
    F: It's eight o'clock.
    M: Can you repeat that?
