## Questions that you might think about (but shouldn't answer directly)

- Who was involved where and when?
- What did you do/what happened?
- How did you feel?
- What did you learn?

## Topics

One topic from the textbook.

- A job you have had
- A natural disaster you have experienced
- Your experience with exercise/sport, dieting, your weight, or other aspects of your health
- Your experience of traveling to the US, or elsewhere overseas
- Some other experience that is connected to Chapters 1-6 from the textbook, or to a photo from those chapters

Don't talk about anything that you haven't done yourself

## Making the recording 

- DO stand close to the camera. We want to see your eyes.
- DO record one complete take of 1 minute. DON'T stop the webcam and then continue from where you stopped.
- DON'T write it down. DO use notes, but keep your eyes on the camera.
- DO tell us first, what you are going to talk about, and at the end summarize what you said.
- DO practice 2 or 3 times beforehand
- DO do it in front of an audience
- DO record it as many times as you like,
but DON'T upload more than one file to elearning.ydu.
- DO time yourself so you keep it close to one (1) minute
- DO say, Thanks for listening, or some other expression, at the end. DON'T say, Thanks for your listening.

## Uploading the recording

- Upload it to elearning.ydu or other place on the Internet
- Don't upload others' soundfile for them. They need to learn to do it themselves.
- Place a clickable link on elearning

- Don't make the entry in elearning for others. They need to do it themselves.
  - Place the entry in the right section, for the final exam.
- Title the elearning entry with your English name, and your subject, eg,
	- Pei, Working at a gas station
	- Jim, Helping my dad on a building site
- Do all this before midnight January 4.
  - Get someone to chack that they can see your video file, starting from the link on elearning (Make sure that the file has been made public/shared)

## Comments on the videos

- [KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

	- If you write it down, you choose to say things which are too complicated for you to say and you won't be understood. Don't write it down. Write only notes.

In the videos in the next slide, Sharon, Joanna, and Adam are reading a script. Don't do that.

- Look at the camera. Make sure there is light on your face. Stand close so we can see your eyes.

- Make it your personal experience. We don't want to hear a lecture about exercise theory, or the theory of work. We want to hear a story.

- Feeling is everything. There is no feeling if you are reading something.
