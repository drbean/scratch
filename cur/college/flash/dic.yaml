          Okay. The software I use to study Japanese is Mnemosyne. And this is the Mnemosyne project homepage. It's an open-source free software for Windows, Linux, and the Mac. I use it on Windows. I even put it on a USB stick. And I can study from home, at one of my jobs when I have some free time, Internet cafes, anywhere there is a computer.

          And it's amazing. Absolutely amazing. I use it to study kanji. I use it to study phrases. I use it to study pictures. I use it to study. And, it's amazing.

          Um, most of these memorization software (and there's a lot out there), are based on the Leitner system. And I went to Wikipedia, Flashcard, and it has something about the Leitner system. Right here.

          Basically, there's, there are some boxes. And the idea is, that all the new information sits on the left. And you test yourself. So, for example, if you had ten flashcards here, you'd test yourself. You'd flip the first one, and decide, do I actually know this. If you know the answer, it goes to the next box, to the right. And you keep doing this until you've put all the cards in the box on the right. Okay?

          So even if you had trouble, you keep putting it back in the stack until you've promoted it to the next box. Okay? The following day, you take these same ten cards, and you test yourself. If you know it again, after a day, you put it into the next box. If you forgot it, it goes back to this box. And the cycle continues. So the more that you know the cards, the more it gets promoted to the next box, and if you forget, it goes backwards.

          So the idea is, you concentrate more often on the cards you don't know. And the cards you do know, or you've tested correctly get reviewed less often. And this area represents your long-term memory, where this area represents now.

          And with Mnemosyne, you input lists into the software,and the computer does the scheduling for you. So you rate the cards. And if you know it, it goes up. And if you don't know it, it goes back to the beginning. Until you can successfully remember what the flashcards are.

          That's the basis of how it works. And in other videos, I'm going to show how to download the software, put it on a USB stick, force the UI to English in case you different OSes with different languages. I'll show how to create your own content. I'll show how to take content that's already available and import it into Mnemosyne. And, uh, I'll show some other tricks if I have time.

          Okay. That's it. I hope you watch the other videos.

          Okay. In this video, I'm going to show how to download and install Mnemosyne project software onto a USB stick, or portable hard drive. I use this software to study Japanese, but you can use it, um, for anything, anything where you have a question and an answer, and you want to memorize.

          So, just into Google, I'm going to type, "Mnemosyne project," and it's an open-source software source. Uh, so it's free. And it's developed actively, by the developer. It's absolutely great. It's the only way to study Japanese in my opinion.

          You go to the Download link. I'm going to choose the setup.exe. Here is the Intel Mac version, and the Linux version. But I want this one here, 32-bit Windows, because I'm on Windows XP.

          Okay. And I'm going to save the file to my portable hard drive. In my case, it's G:. In your case, it's probably different. But download it to your USB stick. Well, it's fast. 

          So here's the file that I downloaded. Double-click. Click Run. And follow the options. I'm going to install it onto my G: drive. Finished.

          The next step. So let's look on the website. Here under Documentation, Advanced Features, it says, Running from a USB drive. Okay? It gives the instructions here. And it says, it's usually in C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>\ et cetera. Okay?

          So you want to find the .Mnemosyne directory. So, so my computer's name is Start. So, I"m just going to go, MyComputer, C:, Documents and Settings, Start, and they'll see Mnemosyne folder. Okay?

          And here is my portable hard drive. So my desktop, my portable hard drive. I'm going to open the Mnemosyne folder. And all I'm going to do is Control-C to copy, Control-V to paste. And there it is. Done.

          So that's how you install, um, Mnemosyne onto a USB stick. So the first time you run it, you want to choose this file, right here, Mnemosyne.exe. Okay? Some computers, it might not show the .exe. And that's because in the Folder Options, under View, you might have this checked, Hide extensions for known file types. If that's the case, .exe doesn't show up. I always in the Tools Folder options, under View, I always uncheck this, because I want to know what the extension is.

          That's a little bit confusing for some people. So, if you don't see the .exe, that's the reason why. And to start up the software, just Double-click. And this is, Mnemosyne. It doesn't look like much now, but this is probably the best way to learn languages, anything you want to memorize. It's absolutely amazing. All right. That's just the first step. Okay, that's it.

    My daughter, you know, she wants so badly for me to move in with her. But I'm of a generation in which your children don't take care of you; you take care of your children, you know. I remember I didn't have the money to buy her a birthday card. And I thought, I'm gonna go out with this sign, "Will Work for Whatever".

    Well dummy me, I get dressed like I'm going to a job interview, and I had to laugh at myself, I'm like, you're looking like, you know, pretty middle class out here. But, this man handed me a 10-dollar bill. I thanked him, and I bought my daughter a card. That meant so much to me.

    I remember it was Christmas. I was in the shelter and um ' I just started remembering when my daughters were little girls. You know, the smells of cooking, the joy. I felt so lonely. But I'll never forget, the women received a gift bag. I got a little bottle of lotion, I opened it up, and I smelled it, and it was the most beautiful fragrance I had ever smelled. And I remember crying because it lifted my spirits so.

    You know in my 30s or 40s, nobody could have told me that I was gonna be homeless at the age of 60. It was a bullet I didn't see coming. Not at all.
