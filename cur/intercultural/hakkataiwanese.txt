In week 4, I will ask 3 students, 2 Hakka and 1 Taiwanese (Minnan) to have a
conversation (in English) about differences between the 2 cultural groups.

I will judge the conversation on how much the group of 3 people together shows
the 5 intercultural competences: curiosity (decentering), knowledge of the
other culture, interpretation of events, discovery (learning and application in
the conversation), critical cultural awareness.

Nine years ago in Toufen, an American man married to a Hakka woman told me his
brother-in-law told him that the average salary in Miaoli was lower than in any
other county in Taiwan.

Miaoli City does seem less developed than other cities. However the area around
the train station does not seem to have died, like it has in Taichung and
Changhwa.

But I am skeptical that there is any difference between Hakka and Taiwanese.

Have a conversation about differences. Try to find out what the other party
thinks of your cultural group. Try to tell the other party about your cultural
group.

This doesn't have to be a conversation about Hakka culture. It could be about
Minnan culture. I want to see you show the 5 intercultural competences.
