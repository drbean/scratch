Fonterra: a classic example of western executives in China "believ[ing] advice in business books that they must avoid making their local partners 'lose face' at all costs."</a>
</p>

<p>
The article says that Fonterra, "tried to persuade Shijiazhuang health officials to raise the alarm without success." And, "the central government had issued warnings about suppressing "bad news", particularly about health scares, during the Olympics period."

<p>
A roleplay about the New Zealand and Chinese directors of Sanlu, deciding what to do about adulterated milk.
</p>

<p>
We do not have to assume either the New Zealand directors or the Chinese directors of Sanlu were bad people. Perhaps they did not know that farmers were adding melamine to their milk.
</p>

<p>
However, we can assume that they did not respond to the problem adequately.
</p>

<p>
It appears that the New Zealand directors and Chinese directors did not communicate well. It appears Fonterra finally decided to request the New Zealand government to talk to the Chinese government, after Fonterra officials were not able to get local government officials to take action.
</p>

<p>
Although there had been isolated reports of kidney problem in July 2008, it was only on 9 September, after the New Zealand government contacted Beijing officials, that it became a big issue.
</p>

<p>
Western newspapers speculated that the desire for a perfect summer Olympic Games was the reason for the delay in action (rather than the New Zealand government's intervention?).
