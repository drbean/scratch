Savoir 5 is just
<ul>
<li>1. having an opinion of a. yourself, b. your ideas and c. what you did to them
and
<li>2. having an opinion of b. them, c. their ideas, and c. what they did to you.

Jean gives two good examples at <a href="http://bb7.nuu.edu.tw/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab=courses&url=/bin/common/course.pl?course_id=_17649_1">http://bb7.nuu.edu.tw/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab=courses&url=/bin/common/course.pl?course_id=_17649_1</a>. The first is, Living with an Indonesian woman, where she criticizes herself. She should have also criticized the Indonesian woman more than she did.

The second good example is Opinions of why students seem not to be very good at English, where she is critical of me.

Try to write the same kind of thing discussing yourself and your intercultural communication experience.

Remember:
<ul>
<li>Be critical. Don't be accepting of yourself or them. There is more than one way. Why is your/their way a possible way.
<li>Be challenging. Question yourself and them.
<li>Be argumentative. Have reasons for your opinion. Don't say, I'm OK. They're OK. Everyone is OK.
<li>Be judgemental. Say what is good and what is bad.
