In week 4, each group will do a discussion of intercultural communication. Choose 2 different cultural groups (men-women, Chinese-Taiwanese, Minnan-Hakka, Japanese-Taiwanese, Americans-Taiwanese, Americans-Japanese, Taiwanese-Filipino, aboriginal-Taiwanese, etc). Discuss an experience one of your group had communicating with a member of the other group where there was a communication problem. Or discuss views about the problems of communication between these two groups. 

In the discussion, show understanding of Byram's 5 types of intercultural competence:
1. lack of ethnocentricity, 
2. knowledge of the cultures, 
3. ability to interpret events in terms of one's own culture, 
4. ability to learn and use knowledge in communication, 
5. critical awareness of one's own culture and other culture.

You will put a one-minute conversation/discussion by ALL 4 people on wretch.cc

You will produce a commentary on the discussion, showing the intercultural
competences, in class in week 4.
