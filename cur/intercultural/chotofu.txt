Scene: Foreign English teacher talking with 
Taiwanese students

Teacher: 'Stinky tofu smells like my 
shoe!' (Lifts foot above table and shows 
students his shoe)
Student: 'That's like in Taiwan, people 
don't like the smell of cheese. It 
smells like baby vomit.'
Teacher: (Fall off chair)

Non-Taiwanese people are not 
ethnocentric if they don't like the 
smell of 臭豆腐. And Taiwanese people 
are not ethnocentric if they think 
cheese has a bad smell.

Which of the 5 savoirs  did the student show:

Savoir 1: Decentering from one's own 
culture (ie non-ethnocentric), interest 
and curiosity in the other culture.

Savoir 2: Knowledge of the rules of 
communication of the other culture

Savoir 3: Abiility to interpret on the 
basis of what one knows

Savoir 4: Ability to learn and put into 
practice what one knows

Savoir 5: Awareness of one's own values, 
critical attitude to them (they are not 
the only values it is possible to have), 
and critical awareness of the other's 
values.
