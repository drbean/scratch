identifier: German-American smiling 
A: You are an American tourist buying a beer stein as a souvenir at a German store. The woman who sells you the glass is unfriendly and unpleasant. She doesn't smile at you. Thinks: "She doesn't like Americans? She doesn't think the stein is a good souvenir? If she is in a bad mood, she shouldn't make other people feel bad too!" None of the German service people you've met have been welcoming.
B: You are sales clerk in a German store that sells kitchenware and diningware. You have never had any foreigners in your store. An American tourist comes in. She smiles at you. She doesn't know you. Thinks: "I don't like this woman. Is she going to ask me if she can use the bathroom? Does she want me to be her friend? Did I do something embarrassing? She is insincere, maybe even dishonest."

A knows a little of B's customs. B doesn't know about A's customs. 4. They don't try to talk to each other and understand the rules for smiling. Bad: A knows German service people don't smile, but is still upset by B.
D: 3. Good: They try to relate the other person's behavior to behavior they know in their own culture. Bad: They are not able to see the other person's behavior as related to their own. 5. Bad: They don't try to question their own beliefs about smiling and how they affect their reactions. Bad: They question each other's behavior but without a basis for criticism.
