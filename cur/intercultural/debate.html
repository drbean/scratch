  I'm Rachel.I have some question to ask you.
You mentioned that we need to take a topic with our soundfile,
and call us write our topic on whiteboard,but we write wrong.
So,We change our topic into : "Foreigners should learn Chinese in Taiwan?"
,don't we? or?

I think that is a good subject to disagree about. Now I want you
to say to Melissa that you are a good intercultural communicator and
you have the 5 savoirs. Say that she doesn't have the 5 savoirs.

<p>
Perhaps. Can you express what you want to argue about as a 
statement like, 'X should (or should not) do Y?'

<p>
Who are the people from the two cultural groups who are coming 
into contact?

<p>
> Which topic is better one for our assignment?

<p>
The topic where you can see a link between Cloud's position on the 
statement and her intercultural commuication competence, as
measured by the 5 Savoirs.

<p>
If Cloud says that American beef should not be allowed into 
Taiwan, you should say that she is ethnocentric, and without   
knowledge of American culture.

<p>
She should say that YOU are ethnocentric.

You mean that You want me to be a good intercultural communicator in this subject but Melissa isn't,So the scene may be that Both Melissa and I are foreigners,I can speak Chinese in Taiwan,but Melissa isn't. AND I need to possess 5 savior to debate to Melissa? For example:

<p>
Savior 1.
<br>
 A:I'm curious now that You move into Taiwan,why don't you learn Chinese?
<br> B:Because I think that my first language,English,is an international language, And lots of Taiwanese can speak English,so learning Chinese is a extra thing to me,waste time.

<p>
Like this,right?

Not exactly. I don't think you should pretend to be foreigners. If you want to pretend to be anyone, pretend to be a Taiwanese lawyer, arguing against another Taiwanese lawyer.

<p>
Actually, I don't think you should pretend to be anyone. However, there is a problem. You may or may not disagree about your topic. If you actually agree, you need to pretend to <b>dis</b>agree about the topic.

<p>
The topic, 'Foreigners in Taiwan should learn Chinese,' is just something to disagree about. In actual fact, you are not arguing about it, you are arguing about <b>who has the 5 savoirs</b>. It is an <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/itl/graphics/adhom/adhom.html">ad hominem argument</a>, which is only indirectly connected to the argument about foreigners learning Chinese. 

<p>
As an example:
<br>
Rachel: You think that foreigners don't need to learn Chinese. This shows you don't have any interest in their experience in Taiwan. You don't have Savoir 1!
<br>
Melissa: I do have Savoir 1. <b>You</b> are not interested in learning English. <b>You</b> don't want to speak to foreigners in English. <b>You</b> don't have Savoir 1.
<br>
Rachel: I do have Savoir 1. I <b>am</b> interested in their experience. They <b>can't</b> experience the real Taiwan just staying in an English-language environment. They <b>have</b> to learn Chinese.
<br>
Melissa: OK. Let's debate Savoir 2. Who has more knowledge of the rules of communication of the other culture and with the other culture?
<br>
Rachel: I do. I have seen foreigners try to communicate with Taiwanese people and they had a lot of trouble because they couldn't speak each other's language. I <b>know</b> about their problems. Because I have Savoir 2, I know that foreigners in Taiwan need to learn Chinese.
<br>
Melissa: No, you don't. I know a lot about English. I can talk to foreigners in English. Therefore I have more Savoir 2 than you.
<br>
Rachel: No you don't. Anyway, let's debate Savoir 3. 

<p>
etc.

<h4>Soundfile example--Not a good example.</h4>

<p>
Listen to Ting'an and Rogers' debate on <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/album/show.php?i=n9661753&b=4&f=1744515036&p=0>http://www.wretch.cc/album/show.php?i=n9661753&b=4&f=1744515036&p=0</a>.

<p>
This is NOT the kind of debate I want you to do. Although it is a good debate, it is NOT about the 5 savoirs. I can only give that recording 9/15. Debate the 5 savoirs. Who has them? You or your partner?

<h4>Savoirs.</h4>

<p>
The more savoirs you include, the higher your grade. I don't want you to say much about each. See the example above.

<p>
Ideally, you will include all 5 savoirs.
