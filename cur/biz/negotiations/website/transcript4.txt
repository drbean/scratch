You, together with C, are negotiating for the designer, who sets up websites for online retailers. On the other hand, A and B are negotiating on behalf of Michelle, an online bookstore operator. They represent Michelle.
The designer is ready to agree the site be finished in a shorter time than the time C said he/she wanted to take. For example, he/she would be willing to have it ready in one month. But this would require some compromise by Michelle on the size of the site and the amount of information.
The designer is willing to incorporate Michelle's ideas into the design of the website, together with your ideas.
The designer is willing to be paid a fixed price rather than the way A mentioned. But in return, he/she would want half of the fee to be paid in advance, before starting work.
C told A and B about the problem of images. The designer however is willing to compromise on images, perhaps one or two images of individual covers of books on each page.
You don't have to change your position if A and B will accept what C said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which parts of your position will A and B find unacceptable? And will A and B accept your new position?
