You, together with A, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
You are not willing to compromise on the time that A said. The site is very important to doing business. You are ready to send books to buyers, but the only way the buyers can contact you or even know you are doing business is through the web site. The quicker the site is up, the better.
You are not concerned about the amount of information on the site just now. You are ready to negotiate the number of pages and links on the site. In fact, any amount is okay.
You are not willing to pay more than the price A said. It is a fixed price which you can't negotiate.
You are ready to compromise on when the designer is paid, perhaps some in advance before the designer starts work, and some after the site is up and working.
A told C and D what Michelle wants in terms of the number of images and the amount of text on the site, but she is willing to compromise on this. She realizes that changes can be made later.
You don't have to change your position if C and D will accept what A said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which offers will C and D find unacceptable? And will C and D accept your new position?
