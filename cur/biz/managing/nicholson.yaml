    Managers need to understand what motivates people. There are some things that motivate everyone, like, people care about their families, everybody wants to make a difference, everybody wants to be respected. But then, more difficult is understanding how everyone is unique and different. And different to the way that you as a manager think. The secret, therefore is to try to know what the world looks for them, through their eyes, that is, the eyes of another person.
    In order to do that, you need to be good at asking questions and listening to people. You need to ask not just any question, but questions that really tell you about what a person's drivers, or unique motivators are. You need to ask questions to find out what other people are concerned about in this situation that you and they are both in.

    Everything is happening much faster nowadays. We used to be going at fifty kilometers per hour. And now we are going at one hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. People are doing more and trying to do more and more in less and less time. Efficiency is good, but because people are working so hard, they don't have time to think about their goals and what they are trying to achieve. The most important things is to stand back and take a bird's eye view, or the view from a helicopter and see how everything fits into the bigger picture, and to take time to reflect. We don't do enough thinking, reflecting, about what we are trying to do. It's one of the things that get driven out by the time pressure that every one is under. So, standing back and taking the wider view is what I recommend people to do.
  
  interculture: |
    Working with people from other countries can be difficult, because what you think isn't what people from other cultures think. We assume everyone thinks the same way, but that's not true. Normally, we don't even think about the differences in the way people think. Of course, when we do work with people from other countries, we realize they are different and they think differently. But do they think the same thing about us? Do they think we are different, or do they think they are the same as us? 
    
    Actually, the cultural differences, although they're important, are not very big. The real differences are the differences between individual people. Just because everyone from Africa looks the same, that doesn't mean they all think the same. Just because everyone from India looks the same, doesn't mean they all think the same. They're all unique and you need to remember that. Treat everyone as an individual, not according to your understanding of the cultural group.
  
  stealingideas: |
    Nicole Wilson: I am a woman and I am a manager. My boss always takes my good ideas to the owner of the company and says they are his own, thus getting all the credit. I have decided to resign, because he is stealing my ideas.
    Nigel Nicholson: Women often suffer from this kind of treatment. But look on the bright side: your boss likes your ideas.  It's the credit you're missing.
  
    What you could do is put your ideas down in writing, and arrange meetings to talk about them with the boss. Say you want to cooperate. Emphasize your desire to collaborate with your boss for the sake of the company. At the meeting, tell him what he could do to support you better and ask him what you could do to support him better. This would give you the opportunity to say that you would like more explicit recognition for your good ideas. But be prepared for your boss to ask you to do more for him.

  A: Some things motivate everyone. Everyone is concerned about their families, wants to make a difference, and wants to be respected. But everyone is different. The good manager tries to find out what motivates you, by looking at the world through your eyes. The manager must be good at asking questions and listening.
  B: Change is happening at a faster speed nowadays. People are doing more and more in less and less time. But because people are working so hard, they don't have time to think about their goals. People must step back and think about what they are trying to do.
  C: What Taiwanese people think isn't what people from other countries think. You think everyone has the same ideas, but that's often not true. When you go overseas, you understand people think differently. But do you know if foreigners think Taiwanese are different? Actually everyone is different. Every Taiwanese person is different. Every foreigner is different.
  D: The boss was taking the woman manager's ideas and saying they were his ideas. She was unhappy. Nicholson said one good thing was the boss liked her ideas. He said she could write down her ideas and ask her boss how she could help him better. She could then ask him to help her by recognizing her ideas were hers. But he might give her more work to do than now.
