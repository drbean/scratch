    A: At the Penske-Wynn showroom in Las Vegas, people didn't want to buy the cars. they just wanted to look at them. The problem was that there were lots of these people.

    B: Penske-Wynn started charging a 10 dollar entrance fee. People who said they weren't going to buy a Ferrari or Maserati, and who just wanted to look at the cars had to pay this 10 dollars. Children with their parents didn't have to pay. Ferrari clothes were also sold.
    C: About one-fifth of the visitors said they were thinking of buying a car, so didn't have to pay. But there were so many visitors, the showroom was getting almost 100,000 dollars a month in admission fees. In addition, it was selling 20-30 cars a month.
    D: The experiment was very successful. But other car showrooms may not be able to copy Penske-Wynn's solution. Other showrooms are not in Las Vegas. They do not have many visitors, and are not showing expensive cars to people who dream of being rich.

    A: The Punjab is one of the best agricultural areas in the world, and one of the richest states in India, but it hasn't traditionally grown citrus. The Punjab government wanted to help farmers make more money. Pepsi wanted farmers to grow citrus fruit to make fruit drinks. The two decided to work together with farmers to grow citrus fruit.
    B: The government told farmers if they let it grow citrus fruit on their land for 4 years, half of the money from sale of the fruit to Pepsi would go to the farmers, and half to the government.  So, farmers gave their land to the government. However the citrus trees did not grow well and Pepsi did not pay a good price for the fruit.
    C: The government spent a lot of money on its good idea, but officials may have stolen this money or spent it badly. Corruption by government officials is a big problem. It now wants to stop growing citrus fruit on farmers' land, but it cannot stop, because it has to keep its promise to the farmers who gave it their land.

Revenue in 2010 was \$1 billion mostly from ads. It is very successful because it puts people in touch with each other.
    B: Alex Tew thinks Facebook changed the Internet, making it a social medium connecting people. The old Internet was like his old site. It was not about people. In 2010, he decided to make a new site, the One Million People Page. He wanted it to be a picture of the new Internet. He invited people to put their pictures on his new webpage, to make a book of faces, a kind of facebook.
    C: Alex left the first space on his new site for Zuckerberg. People paid him \$3 and they could put pictures of themselves and 2 friends. This encouraged the friends to also pay \$3 and put other friends' pictures on. But only 6,000 pictures were put on the site. He then made the site free, but not many more people added pictures. Finally, he closed it down.
