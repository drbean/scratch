    The Hotel Colossus is a big hotel in Las Vegas, in the U.S. It is the most expensive of the four hotels, but it has the most facilities.

    The five-star hotel looks magnificent and has very big bedrooms, outstanding conference rooms, and many smaller seminar rooms, which however cost extra.

    The price is 1,950 dollars, including meals, and one tour, and each participant gets fifty dollars spending money at the casino which is in the hotel, itself.

    Las Vegas is famous for casinos, but there are many other things that visitors can do in and around Las Vegas. The free use of a car to get to these places is included in the price.

    Of course, the casinos are the big attraction. This may be a disadvantage because the hotel is very, very busy, day and night. It may be difficult to keep tourists out of the conference area, and separate them from participants.

    The airport is close to Las Vegas, so this is one advantage of the venue.
