The hotel in Morocco is very nice inside the hotel, but there is nothing to do when you leave the hotel. You can swim in the swimming pool and have fun in the nightclub, but there are no attractions outside. The nearest town is one hour away. (The airport is the same distance away).
There are 2 conference rooms, but no seminar rooms. The cost per person is 1,500 dollars, including the nightclub.

The Prague hotel is smaller and older, but it is very nice, and there is a lot to do in Prague. There is one conference room and two seminar rooms. The hotel also has a large swimming pool, sauna, hairdressing salon and satellite TV. The price is 950 dollars, the cheapest price of the four hotels. This includes two guided tours. The hotel is half an hour by subway away from the center of the city.

\newcommand{\myCcontent}[0]{
The hotel on an island is a big hotel with many large conference rooms and small seminar rooms. There is not much to do on the island except play golf, tennis and soccer. In the beautiful tropical gardens, you can sit and talk. The cost is 1,350 dollars per person. The peace and quiet may be good or it may be bad. It is a long way to the airport. This is a disadvantage.

\newcommand{\myDcontent}[0]{
The Las Vegas hotel is the biggest and most expensive. It has big conference rooms, and many seminar rooms, but the small rooms are extra. The cost is 1,950 dollars per person. This includes 50 dollars at the casino. Besides the casinos, there are many other things to do in Las Vegas. There are free cars to drive around. The hotel is very busy with tourists, which is not good.
