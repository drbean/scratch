    Hotel Moda in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is a four-star hotel, but it is quite a lot cheaper than the other hotels and there are a lot of things to do and see in Prague.
    
   The hotel is a little older and smaller than the other hotels. But the bedroom are large and there is one conference room and two seminar rooms, so participants will be able to split up into three or more special interest groups.

   Other attractions include a large swimming pool (which is, however, open to the public), a sauna, a hairdressing salon and satellite TV.

   The price of 950 dollar per participant includes meals and two guided tours. Prague is a very interesting old city, so there is a lot to do in it. However the hotel is a half-hour subway ride away from the center of the city, and the hotel, and Prague, generally, is very crowded in summer.
