    Hotel Matong, on Tiamon, an island off the east coast of Malaysia, is a five-star hotel with a relaxing atmosphere, but it is a long way to the nearest airport.

    It is quite a large hotel, so there are many large and small conference rooms. People can split up into many small special interest groups. It also has beautiful tropical gardens where you can sit and talk. There is also a golf course, tennis courts, and a soccer field.

    The cost of the venue is 1,350 dollars per participant, including meals. There is perhaps less to do than at the other three hotels, but this may be okay if the purpose of the conference is to discuss business problems.

    The beautiful island setting is peaceful and quiet, so participants may be able to get a lot done. The disadvantage is that it is a long way from the nearest airport. You have to ride a boat to get to the island.
