Transcript: Advice for new start up businesses

   [14]<< Back to podcasts

   [Interviewer] Hello, and welcome to this podcast brought to you by
   Business Link. Business Link is the free Government funded
   multi-channel support service for businesses of all sizes, from
   start-up to succession. In this podcast we asked Karen Darby, founder
   of SimplySwitch, for advice and guidance on Starting a New Business.

   [Karen Darby] People want to set up their own businesses because they
   want the freedom that being an entrepreneur can bring. I set up my own
   company when I was 22 years old because I wanted to be my own boss,
   that is a big attraction.

   But it certainly isn't a way of having an easier life: running your own
   business is very much hard work, but if you get the right support from
   people like Business Link who can advise you on the right way to set up
   a business and some of the pitfalls it certainly helps.

   I firmly believe that attitude is everything and you are the person
   that you choose to be. People say to me 'Karen how is it you're so
   confident and so positive and so optimistic?' I say what's the
   alternative? Should I be negative; does that get you far in life? It
   doesn't.

   My background is that I had to work hard for everything that I had.
   I've come from a working class background, council house, free school
   meals you name it. I think that's been a very good background from
   which to work to achieve what I wanted to achieve. It wasn't just
   handed to me on a plate.

   If you want to set up a business, of course you can do it but the
   question is how badly do you want to do it? You need to give yourself a
   great lever because it's not an easy thing to do; you are taking a risk
   if not with your own capital, then you're taking a risk with your own
   time.

   I think a lot of people fear failure. They're afraid that if they set
   up a business it is actually going to go wrong. I looked at the risks
   and I thought if it did all go wrong what would be the worst that could
   happen? At the end of the day I could just go out and get a job, but if
   you can get help and support in setting up a business that is
   absolutely key.

   To set up your own business I think you need to be a bit of a
   rhinoceros and have really thick skin. One of the key attributes of
   successful entrepreneurs is the ability to see a problem as an
   opportunity and to really go for their goals and to be determined.

   Of course you're going to meet problems, of course there are going to
   be disappointments and failures. That's not the issue. It's how you
   deal with those. When I was setting up SimplySwitch I had to raise
   finance and I had to get out there and raise cash and I got a lot of
   rejection, a lot of refusals, that's fine. You go out there, you get
   your nose bloodied, you pick yourself up and you carry on, but
   eventually you will find somebody who will invest in your business if
   that's what you're looking for.

   Everything you want to know about setting up a business is there on the
   internet. There is an absolute wealth of information; in fact there is
   probably too much information so you have to hone it down a bit.

   I would say a good first port of call would be to go to Business Link.
   This is a completely independent and impartial support and advice
   service that is government backed. I found them to be really, really
   helpful. They have a website Business Link.gov.uk, or you can contact
   them on 0845 600 9 006. That is a very good starting point. They have
   some great tools online that you can use that will help you to address
   all the key aspects of setting up your first business or how to grow a
   young business.

   [Interviewer] Business Link can be found online at
   [15]www.businesslink.gov.uk You can also phone the national helpline on
   0845 600 9 006, that's 0845 600 9 006, or you can [16]visit your local
   Business Link centre for free advice.
