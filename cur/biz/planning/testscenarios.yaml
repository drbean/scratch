It is very difficult to plan, because you can't see the future. But if you have thought very hard about WHAT you want to do and have very clear goals, it is easier to decide HOW to achieve your goals.

    In the best businesses, all the people in the business are excited about the business's plans. But how does the boss get everyone to feel excited about his plans? He has to talk with everyone about the business's goals, and everyone has to feel the boss is listening to what they think. The boss has to listen to everyone INSIDE the company as well as to users OUTSIDE the company.

    William Kendall couldn't sell his previous company, even though it was very successful. So, starting his next company, he immediately started thinking how to sell it, even before it was successful. He decided he had to cooperate with bigger companies, rather than compete with them. He got a very big company to invest in his smaller company. Now the big company owns all of his company. That was his plan.

    In the fastest-growing businesses, everyone feels the company's goals are their own goals. But you can't tell people what the plan is and expect them to get excited about it.  People will get excited about the boss's goals, and their own role in the plans, only when they feel they are involved in creating the plans and the plans have new goals for them.

   The New Covent Garden Soup Company became very successful by selling fresh soups. It started off as a small company, but with the help of Kendall, it became a big company. Sales went from 3 million dollars to 30 million dollars. Everyone realized Kendall was a good businessman, but he also knew a lot about the food business. His parents were farmers.

    When Kendall looked at other smaller food companies he could make into big companies, he noticed Green and Black Chocolates, which was owned by Craig Sams. Green and Black was small but he thought a lot of people were interested in organic food and unhappy with supermarket food. He decided to buy Green and Black from Craig Sams.

    Many years ago, organic food wasn't popular. Although organic food was good for you, it didn't taste good. For many years, Craig Sams had tried to make a lot of money selling organic food, but he had never been very successful. Green and Block Chocolates was different, because people thought it was good for you AND it tasted good. Kendall thought he could make a lot of money with Sams' company.

    At his first company, Kendall had tried to do everything himself. Later he said this was a mistake. He said managers need freedom to do things their way. He thought this makes them excited about their work. The owners have too much to think about, and don't have time to do their managers' work too. The owners should be thinking about the company's plans and what to do next.

    Teresa Graham said everyone needs to feel they own the business's plan by being involved in its creation. Kendall says something different: The business's owners need to give their managers freedom to do things their way. The owners have too much to think about, and don't have time to do their managers' work too. The owners should be thinking about planning the next move.
