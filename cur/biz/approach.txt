My goal, (as it is in my conversation classes 
except for the focus on business), is to have as much 
conversation in English about business taking 
place in the classroom as possible.

Cooperative learning, a curriculum approach that 
to an extent formalizes the idea of students 
talking to each other, is key to understanding 
my methodology in the business class.

In particular, <a 
href=http://www.jigsaw.org/overview.htm>jigsaw 
activities</a> where partners share information 
that only makes sense when they have all the 
information available to the group, and can see 
the 'big picture,' is a way of working I use in 
each lesson.

The content of the jigsaw activities is taken from 
the textbook, Market Leader, (which I think is a 
good book), extending material 
from the Listening or Case Study sections. These 
extensions may come from information on the 
Internet or my personal interpretations and 
interests in the material.

Actually, in Week 15-17, with Unit 11 on New 
Business. I don't think either of these 2 sections 
is as useful as the Reading, which is on 
importance of the Good Team to a start-up 
business. The section also mentions the 4 key 
ingredients of the new business, an innovation, a 
good team, a market opportunity and the right 
financing strategy.

So, the jigsaw activity I developed for groups of 
4 students, A to D, with each student having one 
of the following cards, is:

    identifier:  Dr Bean's language school 0
    A: In Taiwan, many people would like to be able to speak English. Many parents want their children to learn English, so they can succeed in their careers. Many people however don't want to put the effort that remembering many words and grammar forms requires. They also do not want the pain and embarrassment that talking to foreigners often involves. Easy and fun learning, however, is popular.
    B: The financial requirements of a language school are mainly salaries for teachers and administrative staff and rent for an office and classrooms. A bank loan to cover these for 1-2 months would not be difficult for someone with credit with a bank. Dr Bean is not worried about his ability to get a loan.
    C: Dr Bean's innovation is his determination, flexibility, intelligence, innovative teaching techniques, friendliness, easygoing nature, knowledge of languages, understanding of psychology, business understanding, wide cultural knowledge of the West and Japan, Korea and Taiwan, wide life experience, his university degrees, and his preparedness for hardwork and hardship.
    D: Dr Bean's team is minimal. He has his wife, who is Japanese, and who has does not have much business sense. He is good at saving money, but not at using cashflow to drive the business. He is also not very good at making people enthusiastic about what he is enthusiastic about. He is experienced at teaching English, and interacting with customers, but not at setting up and running a new business. He also doesn't have many contacts with other teachers or Taiwanese people in general.

The 5 questions are which of the 4 key ingredients 
does each card represent, and which of the 4 is 
the 'fatal flaw,' the reason that the 
prospects of the school aren't good.

I will probably do variations of this jigsaw until 
Week 18, when it will be the last of my 4 exams, 
worth 5 percent of the grade.

I will have 3-4 parallel forms that will be 
different, but similar, to the jigsaw activities 
each week.

I will stand next to the speakers to ensure they 
use English.

I will give them 1 minute to read the cards, which 
will be simpler than those above, and which I will 
then take from them (though I will have allowed 
them to write on their hands), 2 minutes to 
discuss answers as a group of 4, and 30 seconds to write 
down the answers on a card I provide them.

At the same time, students not doing this will be 
doing the other thing I do each week.

The other thing I do each week, beside selections 
from the textbook, usually the listening 
sections, and introductions, is kind of the 
opposite of the cooperative learning idea.

Conversation requires cooperation but I believe it 
incorporates both cooperative and competitive 
elements. One of the interlocutors gets more out 
of it than the other.

I am trying to leverage this insight
(belief?) into a language learning activity. 
I want to try and turn conversation into a game, 
or competition. The idea is that, if 2 people have 
information that together makes a whole, perhaps 
they can compete to understand more of their 
partner's information than their partner 
understands of theirs.

I am running this as a tournament. Each week, each 
student has a different partner (in theory) and 
partners with the same scores are partnered with 
each other, so everyone has an equal chance of being 
a winner.

The information (about Apple's Steve Jobs and 
ideas about innovation) on Black and White cards 
in Week 15 was as follows (sorry for the mark-up):

    identifier: Steve Jobs and innovation
    White: |+
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \begin{large}Ideas about innovation\end{large}\\
       \normalsize
       \begin{description}
       \item [Ingredients] The most important ability is \textbf{inquisitiveness} or \textbf{curiosity}, wanting to find out. This is something everyone has. But you also need the ability to \textbf{associate} different things, and bring different ideas together and relate them.
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \item [Environment] A helpful environment which makes the innovator feel positive, and encourages innovation is also necessary.
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \item [Desire for success] The successful innovator also has greater desire to succeed and is willing to accept more pain while achieving success.
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \item [Companies] \textit{must} remove barriers to innovation, help innovators organize others, and encourage networking.
       \end{description}

       \vspace{-0.25cm}

        \item [Jobs:] What would be the ideal cell phone?

        \item [Staff:] One with a computer inside.
        \end{description}
       \vspace{-0.25cm}
       \item [Managing innovation] Apple hires people who want to make the best things. Staff work very hard. Apple has very disciplined management processes, but Jobs thinks innovation comes from people getting together informally.
       \vspace{-0.2cm}
       \item [Motivation] Jobs thinks Apple is product-oriented, rather than sales-oriented. His idea is that it should make the best PCs.
       \end{description}

The questions that the students answered 
independently after asking their partner about the 
information on the other card, and discussing it 
(in theory) were:

    quiz:
      - question: Everyone could be innovative as Apple with the cell phone if they pulled different ideas together.
        answer: True
      - question: Jobs was involved with staff in Apple's cell phone innovation.
        answer: True
      - question: The environment that encourages innovation at Apple is not really helpful for innovators.
        answer: False
      - question: Jobs thinks hard work is part of the answer to managing innovation.
        answer: True
      - question: Apple has solved the problem of managing innovation with its work processes.
        answer: False
      - question: Apple doesn't encourage networking by staff.
        answer: False
      - question: Innovators just don't need good ideas. They need to work hard to make their ideas real.
        answer: True
      - question: Companies always make it easy for innovatores to bring a new idea to market.
        answer: False

Students with more questions correct than their 
partner get 5 points to their grade, The other 
student gets 3. If both get the same number of 
questions correct they both get 4. The tournament 
is 70 percent of the grade.

Unfortunately, except for a few pairs, most of the 
discussion takes place in Chinese, and students 
don't try to keep their information secret. 
Answering the questions is not done independently 
in many cases.

However, perhaps the students are using the 
activity in a manner that, while it is not the way I 
planned it be used, is still productive.

When I show each of the above questions on the 
OHP screen at intervals of 1-2 minutes each, 
attention is riveted to them and discussion (in 
Chinese) is animated.

Anyway, most (but not all) of the pairs have exactly the 
same answers, suggesting "collusion" is taking 
place.

This is perhaps a result of the high-stakes nature 
of the tournament.

One of the reasons for this was to penalize 
absentees, who get no points and can fail, 
especially if they also do not regularly do homework.

The homework I do is the web listening activity I 
have talked about in the past. I have different 
forms randomly assigned to the 4 students in a group to prevent 
one student sharing answers with many students.

This may or may not be successful, so I am 
including besides the dictation activity, a 
comprehension question, rendered by text-to-voice 
software, for which a transcription can be 
obtained as the listener progressively fills in 
the blanks in the dictation activity.

Instead of filling in the blanks students can get 
full credit for the homework by answering the question.

My idea, which may or may not be working, was 
to prevent the good students filling in the 
blanks and emailing the other students the 
transcript of the sound file.

Many of the sound files have been created by 
text-to-voice software from texts I have created 
from rewriting the material in the textbook.

Week 15's however, on the Good Team was from a 
Stanford U Entrepreneurial Corner podcast.
http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2107
a question-and-answer session with the CEO and his team at an 
Internet start-up.

I imagine if the soundfiles were easier more 
students would not require help from classmates.

The Dictation exercises and Jigsaw activity are the most 
mature of my methodology. The CompComp activity is 
less mature. I intend to continue to work on 
it next semester, trying to get the 
contestant pairing software working better, and 
working on ways to get the students to use English 
more.
