The purpose of promotion is to get customers. Promotion includes advertising in magazines or on TV, and mailing of catalogs and newsletters to customers. It also includes getting famous people to wear Uniqlo clothes, the way Michael Jordan endorsed Nike shoes.

Japanese rappers Scha Dara Parr wear Uniqlo clothes. They are paid by Uniqlo to endorse the brand.

Other forms of promotion include discounts, give-away competitions, and participation in public events.

Promotion also includes the style of its public image, that is, the look of Uniqlo stores, Uniqlo displays, Uniqlo packaging and the Uniqlo logo 

All these things have an effect on sales of Uniqlo clothes.
