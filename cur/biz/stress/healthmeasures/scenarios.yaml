    If we are going to improve our staff's well-being, I think we should offer a free medical check-up every year, and bring in consultants, like Alan Bradshaw, to help with the stress levels.
    
    Someone like him could identify stress hotspots in the company and raise managers awareness of stress and train them in ways to reduce the stress they put on their staff, while still making sure that they get the work done. 
    
    We have a company nurse, but she doesn't have the ability to identify causes of stress. I really think we need a professional stress consultant.
    
    The last thing I think which is important to improving staff well-being is the question of smoking. Healthy workers are happy workers. I think it would be a good idea to have a no-smoking policy everywhere in the company.
    
    So, those are my three recommendations: One, free medical check-ups. Two, a stress expert from outside the company. And, three, a no-smoking policy.

    I think the best thing to improve the health and well-being of our staff is to improve the food in the company cafeteria. Generally, the food here isn't healthy. If someone just ate the food available in the company cafeteria, they wouldn't be getting a balanced diet. There is too much fatty, salty, starchy and sweet food and not enough fish, fruit and vegetables.
    
    And the food here is not good for people's stress levels. You know how drinking coffee or coke can make you feel more tense and excited? That's stress. And reasearch has shown that fatty, salty, starchy and sweet foods also raise people's stress levels.
    
    To reduce these levels, we need to have more natural foods, like fish, fruit and vegetables, in the cafeteria. Perhaps they don't taste so good as the food we have now, but people will feel more relaxed and will live better lives.

    To reduce stress here at the company, I think it's important that everyone be involved in a lot of physical activity, like jogging, or swimming, or basketball.
    
    It would be nice to have our own basketball court and swimming pool, but that would be very expensive.
    
    Instead, I think we should talk to the manager of the local sports center and arrange a group membership for everyone at the company. That would probably also be expensive, but the sports center has a good pool and a sauna.
    
    I think a lot of workers would enjoy a swim at lunch time or after work. The sauna is also very relaxing.
    
    And I'm sure their basketball court would be very popular. Even now, many people here are members of the sports center, and they use the basketball court during the lunch hour or after work.
    
    They also have a weight room, where people can use exercise machines.

    I think, to improve everyone's well-being and reduce stress at the company, we should have company tours. Every month, we should all go in buses to an amusement park, or climb a mountain and have a picnic.
    
    Once or twice a year, we should travel to some place of interest, here or overseas, and spend a few days together seeing scenic spots, and having fun.
    
    As an example, I think it would be fun and relaxing for everyone in the company to go to Korea and go shopping and eat Korean food, and bring back some Korean souvenirs.
    
    In winter, we could go skiing there. In summer, it would be nice too, because it would be a lot cooler than Taiwan.
    
    When people are having fun, they can forget about work, and they will come back with good feelings about the company.
    
    So, my idea is one-day company tours, once a month, and three- or four- day tours, once or twice a year.

  identifier: stress measures 1
  A: To reduce stress, the company should give workers free medical checkups each year. It should also identify stress hotspots by asking Alan Bradshaw, or someone, to come and check. The company nurse cannot identify stress hotspots. The nurse does not know where stress is worst at the company.
  B: Some foods reduce stress. Some foods increase stress. The company should not provide drinks like coffee, coke and other stimulants, which increase stress. Workers can buy coffee if they want it. In the company restaurant, there should be food which reduces stress, rather than increases it. Natural foods may decrease stress. So there should be natural food in the restaurant.
  C: When you are feeling stress, exercise is a good way of reducing stress. The company should allow workers to play basketball during the lunch break to reduce stress. It should also give workers free membership in the local sports center so they can go swimming or lift weights. Many workers would enjoy swimming after work.
  D: A company tour every month would reduce stress. Workers with their families would travel together to an interesting place. They would not discuss work. They should forget about work, and have fun with each other. Once or twice a year, they could travel together overseas. This should not be for a company conference, where they discuss work. It should be just for relaxation.
