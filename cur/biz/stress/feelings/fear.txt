So many people have lost their jobs. I am afraid I will be next. Because we work in the Human Resources department, we were responsible for firing those people. Now it is our turn to be fired. It's funny, in a way.

It would be okay if there were less work to do, but with fewer and fewer people here now, there is more and more work to do.

We are under a lot of pressure and there is never enough time to do a good job. In a way, I will be glad when I'm fired. Not really, of course. But, the stress is killing me.

I just can't cope any more.
