I, and everyone, else is really unhappy with our manager. We can't talk to her. She never listens to what we say. The only time she talks to us is when she has some new order to give us. The only thing she ever says to us is: 'Do this. Do that.' It's impossible to have a conversation with her.

She never tries to understand our point of view. When we ask her for something, the only thing she ever says is, 'No.' Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. 

I've been patient. We've all been patient, hoping things would change. But the worse the situation the company is in, the worse she has become. She just won't make any effort to see our point of view.

She also never tells us what management is thinking. We have no idea about what management's plans are. If she told us more about what is happening, we would feel much less stress.

Whenever she does speak to us, it is only to criticize us and to blame us for things that are not our fault and to say other unpleasant things. 

We meet our targets, we work long hours. But she never says, 'Well done.' It's very demotivating.
