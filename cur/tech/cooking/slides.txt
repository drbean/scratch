# Vocabulary: base, report-base, test

## Procedure: pre-test post-test

Pretest: Homework Week 6 translate 180 words into Chinese

+ Week 2, 3, 4, 5
After doing pretest, learn the words with Anki or Mnemosyne

+ Week 5 (Exam)
Again translate the same 180 words into Chinese

The difference between your score on the pre-test and the post-test
is your grade for the exam (worth 5 points).

## Pretest

Don't use a dictionary. Give your best answer for the translations 
of the 180 words.

You must write something for each word.

## Google translations

3. The correct answers are as given by Google Translate and there are problems in its 
answers.

	For example, for 'minor,' it gives: minor: 未成年人
	That is only one meaning, and probably not the most important one.

	In any case, this will be regarded as the right answer in the exam. All others 
	will be regarded as incorrect, even if they are actually correct
	
	Do you want to change any of these translations. Report.

## How chocolate is eaten, where is it produced?

Many candies have sweetened chocolate, and chocolate bars and candy bars coated in chocolate
are eaten as snacks. Chocolate is also drunk as chocolate milk and hot chocolate.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed and the cacao is ground to make cocoa, which is usually liquefied. The liquor also may be processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Unsweetened baking chocolate (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Most chocolate is a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat, and sugar.


Although cocoa comes from the Americas, Western Africa produces almost two-thirds of the world's cocoa, with Ivory Coast growing almost half of it.
