# Vocabulary: base, report-base, test

## Procedure: pre-test post-test

Pretest: Homework Week 6 translate 180 words into Chinese

+ Week 2, 3, 4, 5
After doing pretest, learn the words with Anki or Mnemosyne

+ Week 5 (Exam)
Again translate the same 180 words into Chinese

The difference between your score on the pre-test and the post-test
is your grade for the exam (worth 5 points).

## Pretest

Don't use a dictionary. Give your best answer for the translations 
of the 180 words.

You must write something for each word.

## Google translations

3. The correct answers are as given by Google Translate and there are problems in its 
answers.

	For example, for 'minor,' it gives: minor: 未成年人
	That is only one meaning, and probably not the most important one.

	In any case, this will be regarded as the right answer in the exam. All others 
	will be regarded as incorrect, even if they are actually correct
	
	Do you want to change any of these translations. Report.

whole wheat flour

Flour has a lot of _____(1), a type of carbohydrate. The flour used in cooking is "_____(2)" ("plain" outside America), "_____(3)" ("self-raising" outside America, which has _____(4) added), and cake flour. A high protein (mainly _____(5)) content means the flour will produce crusty or chewy breads. With less _____(6), the flour is softer, which is better for cakes.

Flour usually has had the _____(7) removed to prevent the flour from going bad. If the flour has not had it and the bran removed, it is called "_____(8)."
