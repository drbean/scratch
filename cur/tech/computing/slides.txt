# Computing, mobile devices

## Homework

Most students are not doing homework

It is likely that students will fail this class.

# Smartphones

## Smartphone criticism

Dr Bean thinks smartphone use is dumbing down a generation. Instead of reading a book or thinking, people are reading email from their friends, looking at pictures of their pets, or watching movies. They should be reading a book, or sleeping!

The only way to escape this is to stop using smartphones or to become the master of the smartphone, taking control of it by programming it. This is difficult, but it makes you smart, not dumb. So it is good for you.
