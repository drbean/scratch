# Computing, mobile devices

## Homework

Most students are not doing homework

It is likely that students will fail this class.

# Smartphones

## Smartphone criticism

Dr Bean thinks smartphone use is dumbing down a generation. Instead of reading a book or thinking, people are reading email from their friends, looking at pictures of their pets, or watching movies. They should be reading a book, or sleeping!

The only way to escape this is to stop using smartphones or to become the master of the smartphone, taking control of it by programming it. This is difficult, but it makes you smart, not dumb. So it is good for you.

A smartphone, or smart phone, is a _____(0) phone with more advanced _____(1) capability and connectivity than _____(2) phones.

Early smartphones _____(3) combined the _____(4) of a mobile phone with _____(5) of another popular _____(6) device, such as a _____(7), a media
player, a _____(8), or a GPS navigation _____(9). _____(10) smartphones include all of those features plus the features of a _____(11) computer, including web
_____(12) _____(13) and _____(14) apps.

_____(15), about 90% of _____(16) sales worldwide are for _____(17) _____(18) by Google's Android and Apple's iOS mobile _____(19).

_____(1) that combined _____(2) and computing were first _____(3) in 1973, and were offered for _____(4) beginning in 1993. The term _____(5) first _____(6) in
1997, when _____(7) described its GS 88 as one.

The _____(8) mobile phone to incorporate _____(9) features was an IBM _____(10) developed in 1992 and _____(11) that year at and industry _____(12) show. A
refined version of the product was _____(13) to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon. The _____(14) was the first device that can be
_____(15) to as a "smartphone". Simon could make and receive cellular phone calls and send and receive faxes and e-mails through a touch screen _____(16).

In the late 1990s, many mobile phone _____(17) carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of _____(18) such as Palm OS, BlackBerry OS or
Windows CE/Pocket PC. These would later evolve into mobile OSes.

In 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 which became their _____(19) phone of that time. It was a palmtop computer-style phone combined with a PDA from HP. In early
prototypes, the two devices were fixed together via a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design. When opened, the display was on the inside top surface and with
a physical QWERTY keyboard on the bottom. Email and text-based web browsing was provided by the GEOS V3.0 operating system.

In June 1999, Qualcomm released a "CDMA Digital PCS Smartphone" with integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity, known as the "pdQ Smartphone".^[12]

In early 2000, the Ericsson R380 was released by Ericsson Mobile Communications,^[13] and was the first device marketed as a "smartphone".^[14] It combined the
functions of a mobile phone and a personal digital assistant (PDA), supported limited web browsing with a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus.^[15]

_____(1) design principles were _____(2) by and for the Android _____(3) Experience Team to keep users' best _____(4) in mind. For Android developers and _____(5), they continue to underlie the more _____(6) design guidelines for different _____(7) of devices. Consider these _____(8) as you apply your own _____(9) and design thinking. Deviate with _____(10).

## Android Design Principles

Developers are good at writing computer programs, but they are not good at thinking about design and the experience of the app's users. The principles were created by the Android User Experience Team to help developers make their apps useful to users like you.

There a 3 major design principles:

- Enchant me
- Simplify my life
- Make me amazing.

Each principle has subprinciples. For example, Enchant me's subprinciples are

- Delight me in surprising ways
- Real objects are more fun than buttons and menus
- Let me make it mine
- Get to know me.

## Enchant Me

_____(11) me in surprising ways: Subtle _____(12) contribute to a _____(13) of effortlessness and a sense that a _____(14) force is at hand.

Real _____(15) are more fun than buttons and _____(16): Allow people to directly _____(17) and manipulate objects. It reduces the _____(18) effort and makes it emotionally _____(19).

Let me _____(20) it mine:  People love to add _____(21) touches because it helps them feel at _____(22) and in control.

_____(23) to know me: Learn peoples' _____(24) over time. _____(25) than asking them to make the same _____(26) over and over, place _____(27) choices within easy _____(28).


## Simplify my life's first 4 subprinciples are

Keep it _____(1) Use short phrases with _____(2) words. People are likely to skip _____(3) if they're long.

Pictures are faster than _____(4) Consider using pictures to _____(5) ideas. They get people's _____(6) and can be much more _____(7) than words.

Decide for me but let _____(8) have the final say: Take your best _____(9) and act rather than _____(10) first. Too many choices and _____(11) make people unhappy. Just in case you get it _____(12) allow for 'undo'.

Only show what I _____(13) when I need it: People get _____(14) when they see too much at _____(15). Break tasks and information into small, _____(16) chunks. Hide options that aren't _____(17) at the moment, and _____(18) people as they go.

## Simplify my life's second 4 subprinciples are

I
important
interruption

upgrading

I should always know where _____(19) am: Give people _____(20) that they know their way around. Make places in your app look _____(21) and use transitions to show _____(22) among screens. Provide _____(23) on tasks in progress.

Never _____(24) my stuff: Save what people took time to _____(26) and let them _____(27) it from _____(28). Remember settings, personal touches, and creations across phones, tablets, and computers. It makes _____(29) the easiest thing in the world.

If it looks the same, it should _____(30) the same: Help people discern functional differences by making them visually _____(31) rather than subtle. Avoid modes, which are places that look similar but _____(32) differently on the same input.

Only interrupt me if it's _____(33): Like a good personal assistant, shield _____(34) from unimportant minutiae. People want to stay _____(35), and unless it's critical and time-sensitive, an _____(37) can be taxing and frustrating.

Simplify My Life



Keep it brief: Use short phrases with simple words. People are likely to skip sentences if they're long.

Pictures are faster than words: Consider using pictures to explain ideas. They get people's attention and can be much more efficient than words.

Decide for me but let me have the final say: Take your best guess and act rather than asking first. Too many choices and decisions make people unhappy. Just in case you get it wrong, allow for 'undo'.

Only show what I need when I need it: People get overwhelmed when they see too much at once. Break tasks and information into small, digestible chunks. Hide options that aren't essential at the moment, and teach people as they go.

## Simplify my life's subprinciples are

I should always know where I am: Give people confidence that they know their way around. Make places in your app look distinct and use transitions to show relationships among screens. Provide feedback on tasks in progress.

Never lose my stuff: Save what people took time to create and let them access it from anywhere. Remember settings, personal touches, and creations across phones, tablets, and computers. It makes upgrading the easiest thing in the world.

If it looks the same, it should act the same: Help people discern functional differences by making them visually distinct rather than subtle. Avoid modes, which are places that look similar but act differently on the same input.

Only interrupt me if it's important: Like a good personal assistant, shield people from unimportant minutiae. People want to stay focused, and unless it's critical and time-sensitive, an interruption can be taxing and frustrating.

Give me tricks that _____(1) everywhere: People feel great when they _____(2) things out for themselves. Make your app _____(3) to learn by following the same patterns as other apps. For example, the swipe _____(4) is a good navigational shortcut.

It's _____(5) my fault: Be _____(6) in how you prompt people to make corrections. They want to feel _____(7) when they use your app. If something goes _____(8), give clear recovery instructions but
   spare them the technical _____(9).

Sprinkle encouragement: Break complex tasks into _____(10) steps that can be _____(11) accomplished. Give feedback on actions, even if it's just a subtle glow.

Do the heavy lifting for me: Make novices feel like _____(12) by enabling them to do things they never _____(13) they could. For example, combining multiple photo effects in just one step can make ordinary photographs _____(14) amazing.

Make _____(15) things fast: Make the most important feature of your app easy to find and fast to use, like the shutter button in a camera, or the pause button in a music player.
