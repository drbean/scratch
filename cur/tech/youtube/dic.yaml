    Rena: My name is Rena. My Chinese name is Dai RuiXuan.  My favorite things are the color pink, Hello Kitty and cats. This is my cat "Mi Mi". And I think I have a very optimistic personality and I'm a very easygoing person as well. I am pretty outgoing but sometimes still shy with strangers. About my interests, I like to listening to music. I usually listen to English songs to learn English. My favorite  singer is Avril Lavigne. My ambition is... I hope I can work in America in the future, and meet a lot of foreigners so that I can improve my English ability. Thank you for listening.

    Jeff: My name is Huang Che-Yu, I am 19 years old now. I was born in Taoyuan, on April 30th, 1994. I come from a middle class family. There are five member in my family. My grandmother is a farmer. My father is a truck driver and my mother is a career woman. I have two siblings. They are college students too. My mother has taught me to be polite and well-behaved since I was a child. So I can take care of myself and deal with things independently. I am an outgoing person and I like to do some exercises. Basketball is my favorite sport. I always play basketball at the park with my friends. I think exercise is the best way to release my stress, because it can help me to relax and sleep well quickly at night.
