## The homework was very important.

I failed 2 out of the 16 students 

I was not happy with the amount of homework the students did.

This time with twice the number of students, 4 students may fail if they don't do the homework.

The homework is perhaps not interesting.

## Grading

## Aim of class

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.

I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning English.

## Finding something everyone in the class needs to know

A difficult process:

The class is big. Is there some area that everyone here
needs to know about?

- Group writes list of topics they want to learn English for
- Class classifies topics into 2-3 areas
- Each student joins area group to discuss area topics
- Class decides on 3 areas for 3 sessions of the course
