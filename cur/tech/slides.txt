## The homework was very important.

I failed 2 out of the 16 students 

I was not happy with the amount of homework the students did.

This time with twice the number of students, 4 students may fail if they don't do the homework.

The homework is perhaps not interesting.

## Grading 

http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/cclass

## Aim of class

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.

I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning English.

## Finding something everyone in the class needs to know

A difficult process:

The class is big. Is there some area that everyone here
needs to know about?

- Group writes list of topics they want to learn English for
- Class classifies topics into 2-3 areas
- Each student joins area group to discuss area topics
- Class decides on 3 areas for 3 sessions of the course

## Exam 1: Week 5
H1-706

How many words that you got wrong in the homework can you get right on the night?

Australian theater slang: She'll be right on the night. = Don't worry, be happy.

## Students who didn't do the homework get 3/5 if they come and answer 180 words on the quiz

Others get 3-5.

The student who improves the greatest scores 5.

Assuming she/he gets 50 words right that she/he got wrong in the homework, the student who gets 25 wrong words right scores 4.

4 = 3 + 2 * 25/50

## Talking about learning
by talking about computers.

It is difficult to talk about our own learning directly. But if we talk about computers, we talk indirectly about our own learning.

## Problems with flashcards

* Non-contextualized (just single words)
* Language-focused (not communication-focused),
	so meaningless
* Every repetition is the same (no change in the presentation)
	but in the real world, the presented word always changes
## Session 2

learning 180 most common words from Academic Word List

## Academic Word List cloze with words from sublist 1-10

academic(x3)  contexts   percentage range   selected significant specific texts area approach create  occur   similar (encounter primarily)

The [1]_____________ Word List (AWL) was developed by Averil Coxhead at
Victoria University, New Zealand. The list contains 570 semantic fields which
were [2]_____________ because they appear with great frequency in a broad
[3]_______ of [4]_____________ [5]_________ . The list does not include words
that are in the most frequent 2000 words of English (the General Service List),
thus many of the words are [6]_____________ to [7]_____________
[8]_______________ . However, a [9]___________________ [10]________________ of
the vocabulary contained within the AWL is of general use; it is simply not of
high enough frequency to be contained within the General Service List. Words
such as [11]______ , [12]______________ , [13]__________ , [14]____________ ,
and [15]________ , for example, are in sublist one, yet are words which one
could expect to [16]______________ in everyday life, in newspapers, on
television, etc. The AWL was [17]______________ made for teachers to help
students at college or for students working alone to learn the words they most
needed. The sublists are ordered such that the words in the first sublist are
the most frequent words and those in the last sublist are the least frequent.

Medical articles [1]____ from letters with a simple descriptive [2]____ 400 years ago to a standardized form now known as introduction, [3]____ , results, and discussion (IMRAD). The speed at which this [4]____ began to be used and the period it became standard in medicine is not well established. This study proposes to determine the [5]____ in time during which IMRAD [6]____ became the most common form of [7]____ scientific writing.

Methods: The frequency of articles following the IMRAD [8]____ was measured from 1935 to 1985 in a [9]____ [10]____ sample of articles [11]____ in four leading [12]____ in [13]____ medicine: the British [14]____ [15]____ , JAMA, The Lancet, and the New England [16]____ of Medicine.

Results: The IMRAD [17]____ , in those [18]____ , began to be used in the 1940s. In the 1970s, it reached 80% and, in the 1980s, was the only pattern adopted in original papers.

Conclusions: Although recommended since the beginning of the twentieth century, the IMRAD [19]____ was adopted as a [20]____ only in the 1970s. The influence of other disciplines and the recommendations of [21]____ are among the facts that [22]____ to [23]____ adhering to it.

## More on the history of IMRAD in medical journals {.allowframebreaks}

Since its origin in 1665, the scientific paper has been through many changes. Although during the first two centuries its form and [24]____ were not standardized, the letter form and the experimental report coexisted. The letter was usually single [25]____ , written in a polite [26]____ , and addressed several subjects at the same time . The experimental report was purely descriptive, and events were often presented in chronological order. It [27]____ to a more [28]____ form in which methods and results were incipiently described and [29]____ , while the letter form disappeared . [30]____ description increasingly developed during the second half of the nineteenth century , and an [31]__________ organization known as [32]__________ " ---experiment ---discussion" appeared. In the early twentieth century, contemporary [33]______ began to be standardized with a decreasing use of the literary [34]________ . Gradually, in the course of the twentieth century, the formal established introduction, [35]____________ , results, and discussion (IMRAD) [36]______________ was adopted .

However, neither the rate at which the use of this [37]________ increased nor the point at which it became the standard for today's [38]__________ scientific writing is well established. The main [39]______________ of this [40]______________________ is to discover when this [41]________ was definitively adopted. Also, to have a [42]________ idea of the articles published during the studied [43]__________ , articles written without the IMRAD [44]______________ will be [45]__________ described.

## Procedure: pre-test post-test

Pretest: Homework Week 6 translate 180 words into Chinese

+ Week 2, 3, 4, 5
After doing pretest, learn the words with Anki or Mnemosyne

+ Week 5 (Exam)
Again translate the same 180 words into Chinese

The difference between your score on the pre-test and the post-test
is your grade for the exam (worth 5 points).

## Pretest

Don't use a dictionary. Give your best answer for the translations 
of the 180 words.

You must write something for each word.

## Problem

The more correct answers you have now, the harder it is 
to have a big increase in number of correct answers after
using Anki and Mnemosyne.

I offer the students who already have finished entering many
words the opportunity to

1. enter the words again, or
2. do sublists 7, 8, and 9.

If you know all the words in sublists 1, 2 and 3 already,
you will choose option 2.

If you used the dictionary to fill in the words, you will
choose option 1.

## Advice

It is OK to guess. You HAVE to guess if you don't know
the word.

If you cheat and look in the dictionary or ask someone,
you hurt your grade in the midterm.

## == Email sent to students

1. Finish the 179 words from the exercise linked at http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/DictationExercises.html
before Sunday lunchtime.

	At the moment,
	Sat Nov  2 11:50:17 CST 2013
	the standings are as below.

Your score in the exam will be the increase in the number of answers which are 
right between your answers now and your answers then.

If you've only done 12 answers, your maximum score is 12.

If you've done 179 answers, your maximum possible score is 179.

2. Install anki http://ankisrs.net, or mnemosyne http://mnemosyne-proj.org
and download the files:

|	Dr Bean has uploaded decks of cards to the 2 projects' web pages.

|

|	<li><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3916546620">Sublist 3 for Anki</a>
|	</ul>

	Or download the cards from Dr Bean's site as text files and import them yourselves.

|	<li><a href="http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/call/awl_freq_1.txt">Sublist 3 as text file</a>
|	</ul>

3. The correct answers are as given by Google Translate and there are problems in its 
answers.

	For example, for 'minor,' it gives: minor: 未成年人
	That is only one meaning, and probably not the most important one.

	In any case, this will be regarded as the right answer in the exam. All others 
	will be regarded as incorrect, even if they are actually correct
	
	Do you want to change any of these translations. Report.

In week 10 homework some people uploaded a self-introduction
to youtube.

The self introductions are good.

Parsing--Is it grammatical
Transformation--From grammar into logic
Evaluation--Is the logical statement True or False

## Parsing

S = NP + VP
NP = DET + CN | dr_bean
VP = V + O | V + to + VP

Dr Bean was a student.

             dr_bean was a student
		/        \
          dr_bean      was a student
                         /    \
                     was     a student
                             /   \
                            a     student

## Parsing on the computer

Branch  Cat S[Thrd,Masc,Sg][]   [
        Leaf (Cat dr_bean NP[Masc,Sg,Thrd,Nom][]),
Branch  Cat VP[Pos,Sg][]        [
        Leaf (Cat was COP[Pos,Sg][Cat NP[][]]),
Branch  Cat COMP[][]    [
Branch  Cat NP[MascOrFem,Sg,Thrd][]     [
        Leaf (Cat a DET[Sg][]),
        Leaf (Cat student CN[Thrd,MascOrFem,Sg][])]


## Translation

From language to a math formula

Dr Bean was a student. ==  [Exists x1 conj[student[x1],x1==B]]

There exists an entity, such that:
it was a student, ie student[x1] was True
and it equaled B.

## Evaluation

Put in all the entities in Model.hs and see if the formula's true

afld_students    = [A,C,D,J,K,M,N,R,S,V]
other_students = [JS,VS,VT]
students = afld_students ++ other_students

## Bett WH questions

Who was a teacher?
Who was a student?
Who are students?
Who were students?
Who were some students?

Who was the student whose grandmother was a farmer?
Whose grandmother was a farmer?
Who was the student who had a cat?
Who was the student whose cat was Mi Mi?
Whose cat was Mi Mi?

## Problem questions

Did a student have a farmer?

+ Doesn't make sense, but Bett says:
	Jeff had a grandmother
	and the grandmother was a farmer,
	so Jeff had a farmer.

## Problem questions with 'a', 'the'

relatives = [
	"Who was a man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was the man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was a man who was a student?"
	, "Who was the man who was a student?"
	]

## Bett passive questions

"Mindy was born in Hsinchu."
, "Neil wasn't born in Hsinchu."
, "Was Mindy born in Hsinchu?"
, "Wasn't Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Kelly born in Hsinchu."
, "Did Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Neil didn't born in Hsinchu."

Who wasn't born in Hsinchu?

## Question competition

Each group helps champion write a question, 
using words from the list and an assigned 
question form, WH, YN or Tag, or grammar form.

An answer is also written.

## Q and A evaluation

The question's grammaticality and the 
correctness of the answer are then evaluated.

Perhaps we ask that the question and answer 
be evaluated by Bett, by logging on under 
the champion's ID.

Or perhaps the 2 groups evaluate the 
question and answer, with unresolvable
disagreements about grammaticality and the 
answer adjudicated by Dr Bean.

## Deciding winner

After each champion presents a number (the same
number) of questions and answers, the 2 
groups vote on the winner.

They list their reasons for their vote on 
the form.

## Question competition + assigned grammar structure

The champion comes to the board with a grammar structure
which the opponent will follow, asking a question.

It must be different to a prior grammar structure.
If the grammar structure is ungrammatical, the group
gets a second chance.

The champions write questions and answers on the board.
Dr Bean evaluates the grammaticality of the questions
and the correctness of the answers and awards points.

## Bett grammar structures

Tag question	= NP + VP + Tag
		DET + CN + VP + Tag
		Dr Bean  + VP + Tag
		NP  +  V + O + Tag
		NP + V + to + VP + Tag

NP		= Name
		DET + CN
		DET + ADJ + CN
		NP + 's + CN
		DET + V + ing
		DET + CN + RelCL
		DET + CN + of + NP

DET		= all | some | the | a | zero

RelCL		= that + S | who + S | S
		PrepP

VP		= was | wasn't | were | weren't + COMP
		V
		V + NP
		V + PrepP
		V + NP + NP
		V + NP + PrepP
		V + to + VP

COMP		= NP | ADJ | PrepP

## Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

No books, notes
It's OK to talk.
Ask:	Alex, Cindy, Dave, Jeff, Kelly, 
	Mindy, Neil, Rena, Shane, Vicky

It's OK to look at their videos on youtube.

## Preparation for Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

Running out of simple questions, try: more difficult questions

## 1: Questions with 'who', 'that', which are not WH questions, 

	Who was the woman who was born in hsinchu
	, "Was a sister who Dave had a student?"
	, "Was Dave's sister a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister who was a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister?"

## 2: Questions with determiners other than 'a,' 'the,'

Did mindy have some sisters?
Was some sister of shane a student?
Were all sisters of shane students? Yes??

B transcribes C's self-introduction
C transcribes A's self-introduction

Do the first 150 words.

## Transcribing procedures

Divide the video transcript into 3 lines, like this:


Greg: I'm really excited about this multimedia and computer language teaching class. It's something I've always .. I've been doing. I've been trying to teach using computers and also some multimedia. And so it's great to have the chance to talk about that in this class that I'm doing. I'm really looking forward to it.

Greg: Uh, language teaching using multimedia. What is the class about? It's about, uh, using, uh, it's about .. learning, of course. Learning using computers. And I want to do that. I want you to experience using multimedia to learn English and experience using computers to learn English. Uh, like a consumer. Be a consumer of, uh, multimedia language teaching, a consumer of Computer-Assisted Language Learning. 

Greg: But not just be a consumer, because, uh, the class is about language teaching. I want you to be a critic, also, of your experience as a consumer. I want you to tell us what you think. Is this a good program? Is this a good way to learn English? This software, is it useful? Or, which is better? This program, or that program? So, that's just not being consumers, but also being critics of software.
