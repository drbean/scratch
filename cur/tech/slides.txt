## The homework was very important.

I failed 2 out of the 16 students 

I was not happy with the amount of homework the students did.

This time with twice the number of students, 4 students may fail if they don't do the homework.

The homework is perhaps not interesting.

## Grading 

http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/cclass

## Aim of class

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.

I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning English.

## Finding something everyone in the class needs to know

A difficult process:

The class is big. Is there some area that everyone here
needs to know about?

- Group writes list of topics they want to learn English for
- Class classifies topics into 2-3 areas
- Each student joins area group to discuss area topics
- Class decides on 3 areas for 3 sessions of the course

## Homework Week 11: Transcribing partner's self-introductions

A transcribes B's self-introduction
B transcribes C's self-introduction
C transcribes A's self-introduction

Do the first 150 words.

## Transcribing procedures

Divide the video transcript into 3 lines, like this:


Greg: I'm really excited about this multimedia and computer language teaching class. It's something I've always .. I've been doing. I've been trying to teach using computers and also some multimedia. And so it's great to have the chance to talk about that in this class that I'm doing. I'm really looking forward to it.

Greg: Uh, language teaching using multimedia. What is the class about? It's about, uh, using, uh, it's about .. learning, of course. Learning using computers. And I want to do that. I want you to experience using multimedia to learn English and experience using computers to learn English. Uh, like a consumer. Be a consumer of, uh, multimedia language teaching, a consumer of Computer-Assisted Language Learning. 

Greg: But not just be a consumer, because, uh, the class is about language teaching. I want you to be a critic, also, of your experience as a consumer. I want you to tell us what you think. Is this a good program? Is this a good way to learn English? This software, is it useful? Or, which is better? This program, or that program? So, that's just not being consumers, but also being critics of software.

With the name of the speaker, eg Greg:
