## The homework was very important.

I failed 2 out of the 16 students 

I was not happy with the amount of homework the students did.

This time with twice the number of students, 4 students may fail if they don't do the homework.

The homework is perhaps not interesting.

## Grading 

http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/cclass

## Aim of class

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.

I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning English.

## Finding something everyone in the class needs to know

A difficult process:

The class is big. Is there some area that everyone here
needs to know about?

- Group writes list of topics they want to learn English for
- Class classifies topics into 2-3 areas
- Each student joins area group to discuss area topics
- Class decides on 3 areas for 3 sessions of the course

## Youtube self-introductions

In week 10 homework some people uploaded a self-introduction
to youtube.

The self introductions are good.

## Youtube self-introduction problems


Alex's self-introduction is private. Make it public, Alex.

I want everyone to have their own id. Dave and Miu-Miu's videos are
uploaded using the same id. Don't do that.

Parsing--Is it grammatical
Transformation--From grammar into logic
Evaluation--Is the logical statement True or False

## Parsing

S = NP + VP
NP = DET + CN | dr_bean
VP = V + O | V + to + VP

Dr Bean was a student.

             dr_bean was a student
		/        \
          dr_bean      was a student
                         /    \
                     was     a student
                             /   \
                            a     student

## Parsing on the computer

Branch  Cat S[Thrd,Masc,Sg][]   [
        Leaf (Cat dr_bean NP[Masc,Sg,Thrd,Nom][]),
Branch  Cat VP[Pos,Sg][]        [
        Leaf (Cat was COP[Pos,Sg][Cat NP[][]]),
Branch  Cat COMP[][]    [
Branch  Cat NP[MascOrFem,Sg,Thrd][]     [
        Leaf (Cat a DET[Sg][]),
        Leaf (Cat student CN[Thrd,MascOrFem,Sg][])]


## Translation

From language to a math formula

Dr Bean was a student. ==  [Exists x1 conj[student[x1],x1==B]]

There exists an entity, such that:
it was a student, ie student[x1] was True
and it equaled B.

## Evaluation

Put in all the entities in Model.hs and see if the formula's true

afld_students    = [A,C,D,J,K,M,N,R,S,V]
other_students = [JS,VS,VT]
students = afld_students ++ other_students

## Bett WH questions

Who was a teacher?
Who was a student?
Who are students?
Who were students?
Who were some students?

Who was the student whose grandmother was a farmer?
Whose grandmother was a farmer?
Who was the student who had a cat?
Who was the student whose cat was Mi Mi?
Whose cat was Mi Mi?

## Problem questions

Did a student have a farmer?

+ Doesn't make sense, but Bett says:
	Jeff had a grandmother
	and the grandmother was a farmer,
	so Jeff had a farmer.

## Problem questions with 'a', 'the'

relatives = [
	"Who was a man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was the man who was a teacher?"
	, "Who was a man who was a student?"
	, "Who was the man who was a student?"
	]

## Bett passive questions

"Mindy was born in Hsinchu."
, "Neil wasn't born in Hsinchu."
, "Was Mindy born in Hsinchu?"
, "Wasn't Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Kelly born in Hsinchu."
, "Did Neil born in Hsinchu?"
, "Neil didn't born in Hsinchu."

Who wasn't born in Hsinchu?

## Question competition

Each group helps champion write a question, 
using words from the list and an assigned 
question form, WH, YN or Tag, or grammar form.

An answer is also written.

## Q and A evaluation

The question's grammaticality and the 
correctness of the answer are then evaluated.

Perhaps we ask that the question and answer 
be evaluated by Bett, by logging on under 
the champion's ID.

Or perhaps the 2 groups evaluate the 
question and answer, with unresolvable
disagreements about grammaticality and the 
answer adjudicated by Dr Bean.

## Deciding winner

After each champion presents a number (the same
number) of questions and answers, the 2 
groups vote on the winner.

They list their reasons for their vote on 
the form.

## Question competition + assigned grammar structure

The champion comes to the board with a grammar structure
which the opponent will follow, asking a question.

It must be different to a prior grammar structure.
If the grammar structure is ungrammatical, the group
gets a second chance.

The champions write questions and answers on the board.
Dr Bean evaluates the grammaticality of the questions
and the correctness of the answers and awards points.

## Bett grammar structures

Tag question	= NP + VP + Tag
		DET + CN + VP + Tag
		Dr Bean  + VP + Tag
		NP  +  V + O + Tag
		NP + V + to + VP + Tag

NP		= Name
		DET + CN
		DET + ADJ + CN
		NP + 's + CN
		DET + V + ing
		DET + CN + RelCL
		DET + CN + of + NP

DET		= all | some | the | a | zero

RelCL		= that + S | who + S | S
		PrepP

VP		= was | wasn't | were | weren't + COMP
		V
		V + NP
		V + PrepP
		V + NP + NP
		V + NP + PrepP
		V + to + VP

COMP		= NP | ADJ | PrepP

## Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

No books, notes
It's OK to talk.
Ask:	Alex, Cindy, Dave, Jeff, Kelly, 
	Mindy, Neil, Rena, Shane, Vicky

It's OK to look at their videos on youtube.

## Preparation for Next week writing grammatical sentences with correct answers

Running out of simple questions, try: more difficult questions

## 1: Questions with 'who', 'that', which are not WH questions, 

	Who was the woman who was born in hsinchu
	, "Was a sister who Dave had a student?"
	, "Was Dave's sister a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister who was a student?"
	, "Did Shane have a sister?"

## 2: Questions with determiners other than 'a,' 'the,'

Did mindy have some sisters?
Was some sister of shane a student?
Were all sisters of shane students? Yes??

## Homework Week 11: Transcribing partner's self-introductions

A transcribes B's self-introduction
B transcribes C's self-introduction
C transcribes A's self-introduction

Do the first 150 words.

## Transcribing procedures

Divide the video transcript into 3 lines, like this:


Greg: I'm really excited about this multimedia and computer language teaching class. It's something I've always .. I've been doing. I've been trying to teach using computers and also some multimedia. And so it's great to have the chance to talk about that in this class that I'm doing. I'm really looking forward to it.

Greg: Uh, language teaching using multimedia. What is the class about? It's about, uh, using, uh, it's about .. learning, of course. Learning using computers. And I want to do that. I want you to experience using multimedia to learn English and experience using computers to learn English. Uh, like a consumer. Be a consumer of, uh, multimedia language teaching, a consumer of Computer-Assisted Language Learning. 

Greg: But not just be a consumer, because, uh, the class is about language teaching. I want you to be a critic, also, of your experience as a consumer. I want you to tell us what you think. Is this a good program? Is this a good way to learn English? This software, is it useful? Or, which is better? This program, or that program? So, that's just not being consumers, but also being critics of software.

With the name of the speaker, eg Greg:

## Grammar correction

Correct the grammar errors of the speaker in your transcript

I will grade the transcript on its grammaticality.

## Self-introductions not uploaded

Do it before Sunday afternoon, or lose points
You are preventing your group from doing the homework
for week 11.
