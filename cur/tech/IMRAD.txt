IMRAD

   The IMRAD (/ˈɪmræd/) _____(14) is the most prominent norm for the _____(14) of a scientific _____(12) article of the original 
   _____(15) type. IMRAD is an acronym for introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Original _____(15) articles are typically 
   structured in this basic order:
     * Introduction - Why was the study undertaken? What was the _____(15) question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the 
     _____(15)?
     * Methods - When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups 
     (patients, etc.)?
     * Results - What answer was found to the _____(15) question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
     * and
     * Discussion - What might the answer _____(7) and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? 
     What are the perspectives for future _____(15)?

   Besides original-_____(15) articles, other _____(1) types of article include literature reviews, case reports, case series, and 
   meta-_____(5), which usually use non-IMRAD structures.
The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of academic journals since the first half of the 20th century. The 
IMRAD _____(14) has come to _____(13) academic writing in the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine.^^^ The _____(14) of 
most public health _____(12) articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD _____(14) originates in the empirical sciences, it now 
also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide _____(2) of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only 
prefer this _____(14) but also use the IMRaD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the 
use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the "Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals" issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (previously 
called the Vancouver guidelines): The _____(3) of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) 
divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called “IMRAD” _____(14) is not an 
arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the _____(8) of scientific discovery. Long articles may need 
subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case 
reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.^

   The IMRAD _____(14) is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American 
   Psychological Association (APA style).^ The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the social, educational and 
   behavioral sciences.^

Benefits[edit]

   The IMRAD _____(14) has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more 
   quickly to _____(9) material _____(17) to their purpose.^ But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual _____(4) of 
   events or ideas of the _____(15) presented; the IMRAD _____(14) effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary 
   detail, and allow the reader to _____(10) a well-ordered and noise free presentation of the _____(17) and _____(16) 
   information. It allows the most _____(17) information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by 
   summarizing the _____(15) _____(8) in an ideal _____(4) and without unnecessary detail.

Caveats[edit]

   The idealised _____(4) of the IMRAD _____(14) has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a 
   radio talk in 1964 the Nobel laureate Peter Medawar even criticised this instructive _____(3) _____(14) for not giving a 
   realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: "... the scientific paper may be a fraud because it 
   misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper".^ Medawar's 
   criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1965.^^ It is probably a bit too much 
   to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire _____(8) of scientific 
   discovery.
   But Medawar's caveat was sensible as a response to how many students and faculty throughout academia have sometimes treated it 
   as such a panacea. Medawar and others have given eloquent testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.

Abstract considerations[edit]

   In addition to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, 
   however, be composed to _____(6) as an autonomous _____(3) , even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost 
   integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the 
   increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability 
   for an article to be found by its optimal readership.^ Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal 
   requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical 
   content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract.^ Such abstracts are often referred to as "structured 
   abstracts".^ The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and information overload has led 
   some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due _____(11) to the abstract.

IMRAD

   The IMRAD (/ˈɪmræd/) structure is the most prominent norm for the structure of a scientific journal article of the original research type. IMRAD is an
   acronym for introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Original research articles are typically structured in this basic order:
     * Introduction - Why was the study undertaken? What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?
     * Methods - When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups (patients, etc.)?
     * Results - What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
     * and
     * Discussion - What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?

   Besides original-research articles, other major types of article include literature reviews, case reports, case series, and meta-analyses, which usually use non-IMRAD structures.

   The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of academic journals since the first half of the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in
   the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine.^^^ The structure of most public health journal articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure
   originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but
   also use the IMRaD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in

Benefits[edit]

   The IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material relevant to their purpose.^ But
   the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research presented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary
   detail, and allow the reader to assess a well-ordered and noise free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It allows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and
   logically to the readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and without unnecessary detail.

   In addition to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some

Heading style variations[edit]

   Usually, the IMRAD article sections use the IMRAD words as headings. A few variations can occur, as follows:
     * Many journals have a convention of omitting the "Introduction" heading, based on the idea that the reader who begins reading an article does not need to be told that the beginning of the
       text is the introduction. This fussy print-era proscription is fading since the advent of the Web era, when having an explicit "Introduction" heading helps with navigation via document maps
       and collapsible/expandable TOC trees. (The same considerations are true regarding the presence or proscription of an explicit "Abstract" heading.)
     * In some journals, the "Methods" heading may vary, being "Methods and materials", "Materials and methods", or similar phrases. Some journals mandate that exactly the same wording for this
       heading be used for all articles without exception; other journals reasonably accept whatever each submitted manuscript contains, as long as it is one of these sensible variants.
     * The "Discussion" section may subsume any "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions" section, in which case there may or may not be any explicit "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions"
       subheading; or the "Summary"/"Conclusion"/"Conclusions" section may be a separate section, using an explicit heading on the same heading hierarchy level as the "Discussion" heading.
       Which of these variants to use as the default is a matter of each journal's chosen style, as is the question of whether the default style must be forced onto every article or whether
       sensible interarticle flexibility will be allowed.

Other elements that are typical although not part of the acrostic[edit]

     * Disclosure statements
          + Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) trust or believe what you (the author) say? Are you just making money off of saying it?"
          + Appear either in opening footnotes or a section of the article body
          + Subtypes of disclosure:
               o Disclosure of funding (grants to the project)
               o Disclosure of conflict of interest (grants to individuals, jobs/salaries, stock or stock options)
     * Clinical relevance statements
          + Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) spend my time reading what you say? How is it relevant to my clinical practice? Basic research
            is nice, other people's cases are nice, but my time is triaged, so make your case for 'why bother'"
          + Appear either as a display element (sidebar) or a section of the article body
          + Format: short, a few sentences or bullet points
