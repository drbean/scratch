## Why motorcycles is a good technical English topic

- Who rides a motorcycle?
- Who doesn't ride a motorcycle?
- Who doesn't like motorcycles?

Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
English that only some people, not all people, need to know.
But finding something everyone in the class needs to know is important. People only will learn what they need to know.
