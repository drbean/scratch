      \item [Piano Tuning] When pianos go out of tune, they don't sound good. So a piano tuner has to tune the piano. Listening to someone tuning a piano is not interesting. The piano tuner just plays one sound repeatedly and changes the pitch of the note up or down slightly. It is very boring to listen to.
      \item [Nursing home visit] 
        Ron Kroenke tunes the piano at the nursing home every year. This year he is tuning the piano at Christmas. This is not a good time to tune the piano, because the nursing home is very busy. The old people are having Christmas parties and Christmas concerts. Many relatives of the old people also visit at this time of year.
    
        \indent Ron usually tunes the piano at the nursing home before Christmas. But he has been very busy this year, so he could not tune the piano before. However the director still asked him to come. He tunes the piano for free, so the nursing home wants to pick a time which is convenient for Ron.
      \item [Reaction of audience] The old people who are sitting down are dressed up and are surprised to see him. He is worried that they won't enjoy listening to him.
    
      \indent When they realize that there is not going to be any music, many of the old people appear to be disappointed. One woman is angry with Ron. She says, 'If it isn't broken, don't fix it!' Many of the other people also appear to not have good feelings about Ron.
    
      \indent One woman, Rose, however, thanks Ron for doing a good job. Ron feels good that Rose thanked him.

      \item [Concerts] Each month, a woman called Jennifer visits the nursing home and plays for the old people. They enjoy these concerts very much. At Christmas, she plays Christmas carols. The old people sing the carols.
      \item [Jennifer] She enjoys playing for the old people. She does it for free. She knows that Ron tunes the piano at the nursing home and she is grateful for his work on it, because it makes the piano sound good. She sees Ron working on the piano when she comes to play the Christmas concert. She doesn't want Ron to stop tuning the piano. So she goes home quickly. The Christmas concert isn't so important for her. She can come and play again in January.
      \item [Director] The director organizes the activities at the nursing home for the old people. She is responsible for organizing the Christmas party. This year, Ron could not tune the piano before Christmas and the day that was most suitable for him was the day that Jennifer was giving her Christmas concert. She didn't say anything to Ron about the concert, because she didn't want to put any pressure on him. She is also grateful to Ron for tuning the piano each year for free. So, she agreed to Ron coming on the day that was most convenient for him. She didn't say anything, but she just hoped that Ron could finish before Jennifer came.
      \item [Event] Ron came later than the director expected and took longer than she expected. It takes a long time to do a good job, especially if a piano is badly out of tune.
