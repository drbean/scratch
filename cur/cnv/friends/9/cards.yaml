      A: You don't try to be funny, but you are funny because you are not very intelligent. You are likeable but you say stupid things. People find this funny. You don't mind them laughing at you. Perhaps you don't understand why they are laughing. 
      B: You are very intelligent. You are laughable because of the things you do and the relationships you have with people. You lie to the women you love and are inconsistent. You don't intend to be humorous. Your humor is unintentional.
      C: You are funny. At least Monica thinks you are funny. You pretend to be famous people. You tell jokes and limericks. You do skits, or little plays, which are funny. Some of your jokes are sexist, and make fun of women, but Monica likes the jokes. She likes you.
      D: You are funny. You like to make jokes about Monica and other people. Some of them are not so kind. They are sarcastic jokes. Monica probably doesn't like you to joke about her if your joke is sarcastic. But you want people to laugh. Your humor is intentional.
