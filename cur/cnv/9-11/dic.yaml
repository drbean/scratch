    Sean had warm brown eyes and dark curly hair and, uh, he was a good hugger. We met when we were only 16, at a high school dance. When he died we were 50. It was about 9:30 a.m. when he called and he told me he was on the 105th floor and he'd been trying to find a way out. He told me that he, you know, hadn't had any success and now the stairwell was full of smoke. I asked if it hurt for him to breathe and ...

    ... he paused for a moment, and said, No. He loved me enough to lie.

    We stopped talking about escape routes and then we just began talking about all of the happiness we shared during our lives together. I told him that I wanted to be there with him, die with him, but he said, no, no he wanted me to live a full life. As the smoke got thicker he just kept whispering I love you, over and over. I just wanted to crawl through the phone lines to him ...

    ... to hold him, one last time. Then I heard a sharp crack, followed by the sound of an avalanche. It was the building beginning to collapse. I called his name into the phone over and over, then I just sat there, pressing the phone to my heart. I think about that last half hour with Sean all the time.
    I remember how I didn't want that day to end, terrible as it was, I didn't want to go to sleep because, as long as I was awake ...

    ... it was still a day that I'd shared with Sean. You know, he kissed me goodbye just before going to work. I could still say that was just a little while ago, that was only this morning. And, uh, looking back on all that has happened since he died and the causes I fought for and the things I've done, I just think of myself as living life for both of us now. And I like to think that Sean would be proud of me.

    Before I begin, I want to say a brief word about the terrible tragedy that took place outside of Buffalo last night. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends who lost loved ones, and as always, our thanks go out to the brave first responders who arrived immediately to try and save lives, and who are still on the scene keeping people safe.
    Tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life and the value of every single day. One person who understood that well was Beverly Eckert, who was on that flight.

    Beverly Eckert, who was on that flight and who I met with just a few days ago. You see, Beverly lost her husband on 9/11, and became a tireless advocate for the families, those whose lives were forever changed on that September day. And in keeping with that passionate commitment, she was on her way to Buffalo to mark what would have been her husband's birthday and launch a scholarship in his memory. So she was an inspiration to me and to so many others, and I pray that her family finds peace and comfort in the hard days ahead.

    Bannon: A new book called, "The Truth about September 11th" claims to present evidence that the destruction of the World Trade Center was not the work of terrorists, but was in fact perpetrated by the US government. With us, the much maligned book's author, William Gerard.

    Gerard: Most of the mainstream media, they're just too afraid to even have me on. So, thank you.
    Bannon: Also joining us is Omar Al-Farouq of Al-Qaeda. He's an outspoken critic of what he calls Gerard's 9-11 conspiracy theories. 
    Al-Farouq: Yes, Michael, I assure you that is all this book is is complete nonsense.
    Bannon: Mr Gerard, how did you arrive at the conclusions in your book? Where are the facts?

    Gerard: Scientific examination of Ground Zero. For example, the melted core.
    Al-Farouq: Here we go.
    Gerard: We have evidence that there were thermite bombs that were used in bringing down those buildings.
    Al-Farouq: I can assure you, we did not use thermite bombs. I did the research myself. It would not have worked. We flew an enormous airplane into a building, okay? I think it is obvious what caused the building to crumble.
    Gerard: Why are you being so close-minded to this, sir?
    Al-Farouq: How would you like it if you spent your two months in a mountain cave ..

    Al-Farouq: .. two months in a mountain cave, sleeping on rocks, planning something really special, only to have someone take the credit away from us. Oh, no. You don't deserve the credit.
    Gerard: Open up your minds.
    Bannon: Mr Gerard, Mr Gerard. Why in the world would the US government want to stage this attack on their own soil.
    Gerard: Greed, of course. And to increase the oil revenues. the weapons industry, and security industry. And these are all things that Bush and his puppet master Chaney, they've got their stakes in.
    Al-Farouq: Bush's administration, they're a den of jackals. We certainly have common ground there. But what does not follow is why would they kill ...

    Al-Farouq: Why is his approval rating, you know, in El Haman and why is Osama bin Laden safe in, somewhere.
    Bannon: Yes, the Iraq war has done serious damage to the Bush administration.
    Al-Farouq: Here, here. Look, look. I have names, phone numbers, everyone involved in this. okay? I have here the voucher for the lessons, for the flight lessons.
    Gerard: You've got to be kidding. Names and phone numbers. This is obviously forged documents. Come on, did President Bush give you these himself? This is ridiculous.
