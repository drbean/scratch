   Interview transcript

   Sean had warm brown eyes and dark curly hair and, uh, he was a good
   hugger. We met when we were only 16, at a high school dance…when he died
   we were 50. It was about 9:30 a.m. when he called and he told me he was on
   the 105th floor and he’d been trying to find a way out. He told me that
   he, you know, hadn’t had any success and now the stairwell was full of
   smoke. I asked if it hurt for him to breathe and he paused for a moment,
   and said, No. He loved me enough to lie.

   We stopped talking about escape routes and then we just began talking
   about all of the happiness we shared during our lives together. I told him
   that I wanted to be there with him, die with him, but he said, no, no he
   wanted me to live a full life. As the smoke got thicker he just kept
   whispering I love you, over and over. I just wanted to crawl through the
   phone lines to him, to hold him, one last time. Then I heard a sharp
   crack, followed by the sound of an avalanche. It was the building
   beginning to collapse. I called his name into the phone over and over,
   then I just sat there, pressing the phone to my heart. I think about that
   last half hour with Sean all the time. I remember how I didn’t want that
   day to end, terrible as it was, I didn’t want to go to sleep because as
   long as I was awake, it was still a day that I’d shared with Sean. You
   know, he kissed me goodbye just before going to work–I could still say
   that was just a little while ago, that was only this morning. And, uh,
   looking back on all that has happened since he died and the causes I
   fought for and the things I’ve done, I just think of myself as living life
   for both of us now. And I like to think that Sean would be proud of me.
