    "Sarafino: I understand your mom had breast cancer. What was that like?
    Dana: It was very scary. She'd been very sick. And they took her to a hospital. And a physician came out to talk to us when we got there. And told us that she had cancer and that they didn't expect her to survive. And I remember thinking that there was a way that they could have told us that was softer.
    Sarafino: Is that why you wanted to become a cancer nurse?
    Dana: You know, I think so. I can't imagine doing anything else.
    Sarafino: How does it feel to you telling someone they're going to die.
    Dana: Oh, it's horrible. A lot of times when you get to that point, they know it. And you know it. Because they don't feel good. And they know what we're doing to them is not making them better. So a lot of times when we have that talk with them, they've kind of prepared for it.
    Sarafino: Are you friends with some patients?
    Dana: Mmh-hmm. They all teach you something. They've taught me to celebrate the smallest things in life, like hair growing back. I learn about fear. And I learn about hope, and I really learn what love is. Love is that deep, intense feeling for another person's soul. And that it's okay to let that person go. We all don't know how long we're going to be on this planet. And that's why it's important to love each other and to, you know, cherish a human being.
    Sarafino: I really think God wanted you to be what you are, because you're awesome at it. You make patients smile. You walk in there, and they're all like, Dana. Oh, my gosh, she's here. To me, you are maybe the angels on earth. You come down and try your best to heal people. You are my hero.
    Dana: Thank you."

    I remember one time in the first grade, my teacher, she was going round to everyone, and, uh, she asked them what they wanted to be. So she got to me. And she says, Sammy Reed. They all called me Sammy, instead of Samuel. What do you want to be when you grow up. And I said I want to be an undertaker. And, everybody thought that was crazy. But I was always fascinated with the way a dead person looked when you went to see them.
    Coming up, you would listen to the elders talk about a person was killed in a car wreck.

    Coming up, you would listen to the elders talk about a person was killed in a car wreck, and they was messed up and everything. But when you got to the funeral, you would hear them say, Wow, Grandma looked great. She looked at peace. And, and I wanted to know how to do that.

    And whenever I had a pet die, you know, I always would bury the pet, on the side of the creek bank. I would have my little sisters. They would pick flowers, and we'd just stand around, have a little funeral, you know.

    So, I just knew that this was what I was destined to do, to deal with the dead.

    And, I always get this. You don't look like an undertaker. And I said, Well, what does an undertaker look like. They said, They look dead. And, they look old. And they drink a lot. I said, Well, I'm not dead. I don't think I look old, even for my age. And I said, I don't drink.

    You know, a lot of people think because we're morticians, and we're in the business of dealing with this on a day-to-day basis, that we're cold.

    You know, a lot of people think because we're morticians, and we're in the business of dealing with this on a day-to-day basis, that we're cold. But we react the same way when we lose a loved one. I mean, there's no different. And the best part is, meeting the needs of the families. Their loads should just be a little bit lighter. That's what I strive to do every day, to make people feel better.

    Voice-over: Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery has a rich history. But why do so many young people like to visit?
    Picnicker 1: I've been coming to Oakland for years. Um, a bunch of our friends have a picnic every year. It's just a really pretty place. A really quiet place. And in Atlanta, you can get away from the big city and come somewhere that's full of beautiful gardens. And it's just a pretty atmosphere to come and to just kind of have a good time.
    Picnicker 2. It's a good time of year to come out. And the leaves are all changing. And one of the most beautiful cemeteries I've ever been to.
    This one is so well-kept. And the architecture is just amazing.

    Voice-over: It might seem weird that people actually enjoy visiting and hanging out in a cemetery, but as it turns out, Oakland has been a popular tourist attraction for over a hundred years.

    Foundation representative: That is, in Victorian times, the concept of a graveyard was transformed and elevated into the concept of a cemetery, which is Greek for sleeping place.
    And so, people would come and bury their dead in a very beautiful, um, garden setting with walkways and walls, as we have here. And when the funeral was over, weeks and months would go by, and the families would come back here, to tend to the graves of their relatives and at the same time, enjoy what was then important green space for them.

    Ghost hunter: I noticed that like cemeteries themselves, as far as places to find ghosts, aren't always the best idea. Because people don't reside in that type of environment. Like, look. Cemeteries aren't the best places to go ghost hunting. Because a lot of that residual energy that we were talking about existing in a lot of these types of events doesn't occur there. You'll get that type of stuff at the scene of accidents and stuff. And that's probably where we're going to see your apparitions. Just the trauma of the event even can create an impression.

    Well, I mean, for a beginning level, I think you'd want to visit a cemetery. It's spooky. It's at night. You got the atmosphere.

Make this device in my hand light up. You died in 1893. Philip. Barbara, your wife. Why do you have two more graves in here with no markings? So, they're not dead? Or did they choose not to be buried with you?

    Jerald: My first day on the job was seven bodies that we got in, messed up bad. The next day, more bodies. We had some eleven, twelve hundred Americans that went through in my time frame. And so many of them I knew. When you would see a name, and then you would see who was there, that was very tough.

    I'd go into the refrigeration unit. I'd go in there - nobody could hear me. I'd scream as loud as I could, and nobody knew. I'm proud that I didn't commit suicide. That's all I can say. I would have liked to have never had the experience. It changed me forever. 

    Gary: You'd look for body marks, like scars, tattoos.
    Glen: There were times when we would get bags of remains in from the field. And we'd be opening them up.
    Gary: It was like a puzzle.

    Gary: You can get out of it, yeah.

    Glen: They can't keep you in it.

    Gary: The mortuary part, they always consider it to be demoralizing to the troops that are out in the field fighting. So they kind of just keep us hidden. About five years ago, I remember meeting a guy, he was an infantryman.

And, I always felt, oh, I got out of Vietnam, didn't have a scratch, didn't get wounded at all. And then all that hit. I did go to some counseling, and I was talking to one of the psychiatrists ..

    Gary: Probably the fact that I was there to help their son get back home. It didn't matter that people didn't know we were there. We were there to do our job.

    Glen: And our job was to take care of the soldiers that came in from the field and to treat them as if they were family.

    I thought it would be great to welcome these young trauma nurses with some special Hawaiian lei. And I saw this army nurse come walking up the path and I said, Here, this is a special gift from me to you. She put her head down so I could put the lei over her shoulders she noticed the button that I was wearing on my chest and she just put her finger on it, and she said, I know him. I said, How do you know him? He was my son. And she said, I was the trauma nurse ..

And I gave her a big hug and you could hear this very audible gasp of all the people that were standing around us. But I could sense that something was bothering her and I thought she may have sensed that my family might have been disappointed at the fact that our son, his life could not have been saved. And I said, I want you to know ..

    .. that my son was a warrior, he absolutely recognized all of the risks that were involved. She cried and she said that as the head trauma nurse one of her tasks was to prepare his body for his men to have a last viewing. And she said that she tried to close his eyes but as she went to press his lids together, they'd always would come open just a little bit and she said that has bothered her all this time. And I looked at her and I laughed and she kind of gave me this puzzled look ..

His men, when they were in combat, they were never certain what they could do when the Lieutenant was sleeping. Because they never knew if he was sleeping or if he was just awake watching what they were doing. And I said, the simple fact that you shared that story with me totally convinces me now that you were with my son when he died. It was one of those miracles at The Wall. It was absolutely remarkable.
