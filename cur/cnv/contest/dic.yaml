    00:06 Dennis Miller: The first student I talked with was Eden Hartwell, of Mt Upton, New York.
    00:09 She's a forensics major. Let's jump right into the conversation.
    00:13 Miller: Favorite food.
    00:15 Eden: My mom's spaghetti.
    00:16 Miller: How does she make that that's your absolute favorite food?
    00:19 Eden: She just makes the best sauce.
    00:21 Miller: Yeh?
    00:22 Eden: Yeh. (laughs)
    00:22 Miller: ... have to try that sometime.
    
    00:24 Miller: And your favorite color?
    00:24 Eden: Pink.
    00:25 Miller: Okay. You're not wearing any pink! (laughs)
    00:30 Eden: (laughs)
    00:31 Miller: Okay, pink sneakers.
    00:32 Eden: Yup.
    00:32 Miller: Okay. You got 'em. You got 'em.
    00:32 Eden: (laughs)
    00:34 Miller: And you said before when you were talking that uh, your whole room is, is done in pink.
    00:38 Eden: Yeh. Mmh-hmm.
    00:39 Miller: Does your roommate like pink too?
    00:41 Eden: I think she likes it, but she doesn't have any pink, there.
    00:44 Miller: She also didn't have any choice the way you decorated it.
    00:46 Eden: Right. (laughs)
    00:47 Miller: (laughs)
    00:48 Eden: My half of the room is pink, and hers is whatever color she wants it to be. I don't know. (laughs)
    00:53 Miller: Okay, so you guys worked that out beforehand.
    00:54 Eden: Yeh.
    
    00:55 Miller: Now you were telling me that you got to know your roommate through uh, email during the summer, 
    01:01 Eden: Yeh.
    01:01 Miller: which struck me as a really good way to do things.
    01:04  Miller: Did you contact her, or she contacted you?
    01:07 Eden: Actually, during orientation, we had a time, where we just sat with a group of people and talked to them, and then we chose our roommate.
    01:15 Eden: So we exchanged emails, and screen names, and everything like that, then.
    01:21 Eden: So we had the few months before we came, to get to know each other.
    01:24 Miller: Again, that strikes me as a really good way to do things.
    01:26 Miller: How did you get to know each other?
    01:28 Miller: Did you ask each other what you like?
    01:30 Eden: Yeh. We just asked each other what our hobbies were, or sleep habits and things like that.
    01:37 Eden: Things that you would ask people that you were going to live with.
    01:40 Miller: So when you guys got together during the first days of school, you had pretty much a lot of those things out of the way.
    01:46 Eden: Yeh.
    01:47 Miller: Okay, I know you like this and you don't like this. 
    01:48 Eden: Mmh-hmm. Yeh. So it was really easy to move in that way.
    
    01:52 Miller: Your favorite band.
    01:54 Eden: Coheed and Cambria. Mmh-hmm. I just, I really like their music. And my boyfriend introduced them to me and I've been hooked ever since.
    02:03 Miller: And I need to ask about your favorite movie?
    02:06 Eden: The Nightmare Before Christmas.
    02:09 Miller: Your hobbies.
    02:09 Eden: My hobbies.
    02:11 Eden: I danced for fourteen years.
    02:13 Eden: Everything, ballet, tap, jazz.
    02:15 Eden: And I did a lot of acting in school.
    02:18 Eden: And I have horses.
    02:20 Eden: So I ride horseback.
    02:23 Eden: And I do a lot of like, crafting. I knit and sew, and crochet.
    02:30 Miller: How do you fit all that stuff in.
    02:32 Eden: I don't know. (laughs)
    02:33 Miller: Ha-ha-ha!
    
    02:35 Miller: The first day that you came here, that your mother brought you here.
    02:39 Eden: Yeh.
    02:40 Miller: And she drove away, and you were on your own.
    02:43 Miller: What, what were your feelings, right at that point?
    02:47 Eden: The whole situation wasn't as hard for me, because I'd been an exchange student last year.
    02:52 Eden: So I had already gone through having to be alone and without my parents.
    02:57 Eden: So I guess it wasn't as hard as it could have been.
    03:01 Eden: But I did get sad when my mom drove away, and she tapped on her brakes.
    03:08 Eden: Because she always did that to say goodbye when she left me at the baby sitter.
    03:13 Eden: So that was kind of heart-touching. (laughs)
    03:15 Miller: Yeh.

    My dad, he wanted me to be a farmer. I didn't want to be a farmer, so he wouldn't help me in school. So I put myself through school. I had ten dollars, and I walked up to the bursar's office, threw my two five dollars bills up there on the counter, and I never shall forget the bursar said, what are you planning to do? I said, well, I plan to make something out of myself. He saw this country boy, took me over to the side; he didn't want to embarrass me. He said, but you can't go to school with ten dollars. I said, but I've got to go to school. So he took me to the dean and he said, here's a young man trying to go to school with ten dollars. What can we do for him? He said, can you drive a truck? And I said, yes. I couldn't drive a truck. Never drove. Heck, I couldn't drive a car, let alone a truck. So he gave me a job of hauling trash from one of the girl's dormitory over to the incinerator. I didn't know what I was doing, but by the grace of God, I did it.

    That took care of my tuition, but they didn't know I didn't have a place to stay. I went up on the third floor in the dormitory and slept between two mattresses. And one morning the matron of the dormitory came up and saw me, and it scared her. She took me before the discipline committee - two women. I shall never forget, both of them broke down and cried when I told them my story.

    And from that day forward, I never looked back. They gave me everything that I needed. And that's why I've always felt that, as long as I live, I was going to use my life to reach out and touch another life with hope. And I was the first African-American to be the director of the Bureau of Food Sanitation for the City of Detroit Health Department.

    There was a young lady who came to the Health Department to work with us from Northern High School. She was hostile. She didn't want to be anything. She came from a family of seven - some of them were on drugs - and she had every right to be mad. So I sat her down and I talked to her. I said, you see this big desk here? It wasn't designed for me. You see these drapes? They weren't designed for me. Do you see these fingers? Way back in the South, in the sticks, I picked cotton. But do you see where I am today? And she became a different person. She said, Mr. Young, when I finish high school, will you help me to get a job? I hired that young lady.

    That's been over 19 years ago. She has two teenage kids, has a wonderful husband. She's an executive secretary today. That is the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. If you just put your arms around people, they will go forward in life â€” and that's my mission.

    Mother: What are some things that you wish people knew about dyslexia?

    Daughter: I wish people knew that it's not like an illness of the brain, it's a difference of the brain. I mean, every brain is a little bit different. Maybe ours are just a little bit more.

    Mother: Do you remember when you were trying to learn how to read?

    Daughter: Yeah. I hated every second of it, actually. But someone - and she's sitting right in front of me - inspired me and helped me do it. When you were helping me read, did you ever, for a moment, think that I wouldn't be able to?

    Mother: I never believed that you wouldn't learn how to read. But, you know, I got frustrated at first. I was like, there is the word, you just said it, why can't you read it again? And I didn't understand what was going on because I knew you were so smart. And then, when we talked to your teachers, and they helped us see what was going on, then I knew how to help you.

    But what I did worry about was whether you would ever really love to read. Because I love to read, and dad loves to read, and we wanted you to have that.

    Daughter: Yeah. I do love reading and now, I'm probably one of the biggest readers in my class. It's changed a lot.

    Mother: Does that factor in when you think about what you want to do with your life?

    Daughter: Yeah, I want to be a humanities teacher, and I want to help people who are dyslexic do, like, spelling and reading and stuff, because those are the things that were really hard for me.

    Mother: Yeah. Well, what do you think that you've learned about yourself that you might not have learned if you weren't dyslexic?

    Daughter: That I can work hard. I can have to do something - and do it. It's not easy - it's not easy for anyone - but I can do it.

    Lucky: My mother and father divorced when I was seven and we went to live with my grandparents, Mama Willie and Daddy Charlie. It was in the country, it was really in the country. We had a swamp behind the house. I used to sit in my bedroom at night on top of my bed and shoot alligators through the window with a .22 rifle. And the road ended at our garage. If somebody was coming down the road, they were either coming to see us, or they were lost.

    Debi: Now, Ma Willie, I remember she was real feisty.

    Lucky: One thing about Ma Willie, she had a wooden spoon that she carried all the time. She carried it in her apron pocket. That thing could telescope out to 50 yards, I know, for sure, 'cause if you messed up, you could not outrun that spoon. She would ping you right on the top of the head with it, I don't care how fast you tried to run, that spoon would hurt.

    And my grandfather, he was quite a man. I think he finished maybe the eighth grade, maybe. But he could do anything he wanted to do. He and my grandmother, they bought a little cafe there. It's just a little hole-in-the-wall-like place. And one day a guy, he was a sign painter. He came in and he told my granddaddy, he says, if you'll feed me, I'll paint a sign, any sign you want on the front of your cafe. He says, just write it out and give it to me. So my grandfather says sure.  So he printed out Ferrell's Cafe real nice and neat, handed it to the guy.

    The guy goes out, a little while later he comes in and says, well your sign's ready, I'm ready to eat. My grandfather says, well let's go out and look at it. He went out and he looked and it was upside down. The man couldn't read. Whatever my grandfather printed on there, that's what he painted.

    Debi: Well, did he keep that?

    Lucky: No, it stayed there for years. In fact when they sold the cafe, it was still there. And people used to ask him, said, Charlie, why don't you have that sign fixed? He says, nope, people come by here, then they'll stop and come in and ask me why that sign's upside down. They always gonna drink a cup of coffee, eat a piece of pie, a hamburger, something. He said, it's the best advertising I ever had.

    Jim: In 1966, I enlisted in the army for service in Vietnam. At that same time, Don was battling his diabetes.
    Don: It basically destroyed my outlook on what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I had enlisted for Air Force service, and soon as I called 'em up, and told them I was a diabetic, they rejected me.
    Jim: You were headed for the Air Force maybe as a career.
    Don: Yeh, with the last name 'Sargent,' it's the only thing I ever thought of my whole life. And I was ready. And I wasn't. But I remember just before you left to go to Vietnam. That's the only time my heart was ever broken. I worried about you more than I could ever think that I could. Every night, we used to sit in front of the TV and look for the names as they come past for the deceased and missing. And we applauded and cried for each other, when we saw your name wasn't there. And I remember when I got to see your medals. That was quite humbling for me, to know that my brother was such a hero. Beyond what I thought he was.
    Jim: Uh, what I went through doesn't even make the first notch on the measurement as to what you've gone through. Since you have had diabetes, not once in all of this time have I ever heard you complain. Even the times that I visited you in the hospital, when you were conscious, you were smiling. So, if admiration is something that I'm to be given, man, you get a case of it, not a six-pack, you get a case. That's how I feel about you, Don.
    Don: Well, I've loved you from the first day I remember you. I remember you taking me around the front yard and watching the trains go down the street. I wasn't eighteen months old then, but I remember that.
    Jim: I'm proud to be your brother and, you're my guy. So, ...
    Don: And you're my guy and I love you.
    Jim: Thank you, brother.

    Strozier: Frank was a big guy. He weighed 13-and-a-half pounds when he was born. And one day - I was about nine - and we had these little neighborhood gangs back then. They were these little kids all about the same age who played together all the time, but then all of the sudden they would have raids on each other.

    And one day, we were out playing marbles when we looked up and the Hill Gang came around the corner. There was about five or six of them. And so we picked some rocks. They started throwing at us and we started throwing back at them. I was pretty athletic when I was little, and at the time my hero was Bob Feller. And I was going to be a Major League pitcher like Bob Feller.

    So, I picked out Freddy Almond, who was the oldest guy, and I hit him right in the middle of the forehead, and it decked him.

    Smith: Did it draw blood?

    Strozier: It drew plenty of blood. He was screaming like crazy and all the other kids disappeared. And we were about ready to disappear ourselves. Freddy came out with his father, Mr. Almond, and Mr. Almond called me out. He said I'm going to give you a whipping. I was scared to death.

    About that time, my brother, Frank, came down the side of the house on his bicycle and skidded into the front yard and dropped the bicycle and said, you know, what's going on? And so Mr. Almond said your brother has laid out my son's head, and I'm going to give him a whipping. And so my brother Frank said, no, sir.

    He said, what do you mean, sonny? He said my name's Frank, sir, and you're not going to give him a whipping. Frank was about 5-9, and Mr.  Almond was probably about 5-8. His son was standing there, and my brother said you're going to have to whip me first sir, and I don't believe you can do it.

    My father can take care of this and my family can take care of this, and I will not let you touch my brother without coming through me first. He backed off, and they left. Frank was a very authoritative kid. I've never known anybody as totally fearless as he was. And Frank was just a wonderful big brother.

    I had been told that I had a broken leg. What I didn't realize was that the leg was not broken, it was shattered. After a number of surgeries, it became apparent that I would not be able to keep the leg. And as everybody was making plans for my life without a leg, a young hospitalist came up to me and said, Andy, what kind of golf ball do you play?

    As I'm thinking about life without a leg - and it would be removed mid-thigh -talking about golf balls seemed almost idiotic. But I did respond that the kind of golf ball I played was a Titleist Pro V1. I woke up in the morning and there were flowers around my room, and right in the middle of all those flowers was a yellow 12-pack of Titleist Pro V1.

    That hospitalist, Sarah, had purchased those for me. And Sarah brought hope. She had helped me stop thinking about how sorry I should feel for myself, and she brought a glimmer of hope that there would be something after loss of leg.

    I woke up in recovery and I had ten toes. There was a little bit of blood flow and they decided not to take the leg. And when I was to be released, Sarah came in that day to wheel me from my room to the ambulance. She and I had developed a very, very close relationship.

    And Sarah shared with me that she had lost her father and she asked me to do her a favor. She said, I'd like you to walk me down the aisle.  And I said, Sarah, you don't have a boyfriend. She said, someday I will. I started to think: I'm going to this next hospital knowing that I might not get out of a wheelchair and she asked me to walk her down the aisle.

    Now, this accident took place seven years ago in September of '02, and this summer I got an email from her saying, I have a boyfriend; will you come? And I had the privilege of walking, rather than wheelchairing, of walking, Sarah down the aisle.

    Father; My dad was a pretty serious alcoholic. And my mom kept a low profile and just tried to survive. And you know, I remember feeling somewhat lost. Um, I wanted to be a very different kind of parent.
    Daughter: And parenting four girls, huh? Did you ever imagine that?
    Father: I never imagined it, but when guy friends would say to me, Well, don't you want a boy? I used to say to them, No, because I had such a bad experience as a boy that it kind of scares me to be a male role model for a boy. So I was real happy to have girls. And still are.
    Daughter: How do you think parenting has changed you?
    Father: It changed me from the moment my children came onto this Earth.  Catching you as you emerged into this world, cutting your umbilical cord, washing you off, was the highest high I think I could ever experience. Although when you and I walk down the aisle, I know I am probably going to cry for a week. You know, I caught you with my catcher's mitt, maybe I'll give you away with my catcher's mitt, or something special.
    Daughter: Sound's great. So, what advice do you have for me when thinking about parenting?  
    Father: You know, anyone can conceive a child. Just follow your instincts and you can make a baby. But there's a lot one can learn about being a parent. I know that what you tell your kids doesn't matter. What you show them, what you model for them, is everything. And the thing that helped me so much and always has and always will is the love and support and the presence that my daughters allow me to have in their lives. I'm so grateful for that, Maya.
    Daughter: I'm grateful for you. Thank you for the chance to share this conversation.
    Father: I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

  - Racism and a Boy Scout's good deed

    It was my first year as a Boy Scout. Scouting had just come to the black community. And I'm in it for one of the first troops. And I'm very, very excited about fulfilling all of the obligations of the Boy Scouts, and I've got so much enthusiasm. I've got so much anxiety to be the best Boy Scout I can possibly be.

    One of the admonitions that we had was that we had to do a good deed every day. And so I was downtown in Tulsa, standing at the street corner waiting for the light to turn. And I've got my eyes on people, and things. What can I do to perform a good deed for the day? I've got to perform one, just have to.

    And I saw this woman as she was stepping off the curb. She had a cane and she was feeling like that. And I said, 'Oh my goodness, she can't see,' And so I walked up to her and I said, 'Could I help you across?' She said, 'Oh, yes, Oh, yes, I'm so glad.' And she grabbed on my arm as though I was the last person on earth."

    We got about halfway across the street. She's so happy and laughing and talking. And then she said, out in the middle of the street, she said, 'Are you white or black?' And I guess she said colored in those days. And I told her I was colored, and she said, 'Get your filthy hands off of me,' and I got my hands off of her."

    And I reflected on that: That this woman, who could not see and who was in desperate need of help, was not as interested in help as she was in being certain that a young black man didn't touch her. And I knew then that we were in deep trouble to overcome that kind of racial hostility."

    Son: Thank you, Dad.
