       Volume: .5 linear feet
       Organization/Arrangement: Organized as a single series.
       Biographical Note: Joyce Butler was born in Portland, Maine on June 27, 1933. She graduated from
       Westbrook Junior College in 1953 and in 1955 earned her B.A. in English from Boston University. She
       was married that same year to Robert Butler and the couple moved to Kennebunk in 1967. Raising her
       three children and restoring their old house gave Butler plenty of writing inspiration. She
       approached the editor of the York County Coast Star with a short piece about the house, and she was
       subsequently asked to write a regular column. She continued this column for ten years, detailing
       her experiences as a housewife and mother in small town Maine.
       Her first book, Pages from a Journal (1976) is a collection of these writings. In 1974 she began a
       second column for the Star on Kennebunkport history. Her fascination with local history culminated
       in a position as archivist at the Kennebunkport Historical Society, which she held from 1975 to
       1979. Her most well known book, Wildfire Loose, was published in 1978, and is an account of the
       1947 fire of Maine. The book was chosen as one of Maine's 100 distinguished books by the Baxter
       Society's 2001 Maine bibliography, Mirror of Maine.
       Additionally, Butler served as curator of manuscripts and exhibitions at the Brick Store Museum
       from 1980 to 1995, appointed town historian for Kennebunk in 1990, and was curator of museum
       collections at Maine Historical Society from 1996 to 2000. Butler is also a prolific freelance
       writer, with poems and stories published in magazines and newspapers such as York County Coast
       Star, Down East, Maine Life, Lady's Circle, Chapters in Local History, and Log of Mystic Seaport.
       Description: This collection consists mostly of published articles and essays on Maine history,
       written by Butler between 1970-1986. Also included are promotional material and reviews for her
       published books, and one folder of biographical material.
