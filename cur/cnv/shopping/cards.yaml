      A: It's inconvenient for the staff to have this guy living in your store for a week, but the video he is making will be good publicity for IKEA, and having people see the video being made will also be good publicity. You ask a shopper, James, to wheel him back to his "home" in a shopping cart.
      B: Your husband hasn't been with you for some weeks. He asks you to go on a "date" at his new home, IKEA. He introduces you to the manager, Scott. You ask Scott if he is being a nuisance, but Scott just smiles. You know your husband is a very annoying person.
      C: You are asked by the manager of the IKEA store to cooperate with Mark making his video. Mark says he is lost and he asks you very forcefully to wheel him back to his IKEA "home" in your shopping cart. This is an imposition, but you cooperate because the manager asked you to.
      D: You are making a video about living in IKEA. The place is so big and so well furnished that it is nicer than the place you live in. In fact, it would cost \$3,000 a month to have such a nice apartment. You invite your wife, Wanda on a date to the store. You want to make it very romantic, so you dress up.
