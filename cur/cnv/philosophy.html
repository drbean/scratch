<h1>The philosophy of this conversation course</h1>
<h2>Cooperative and competitive</h2>
I think conversation is both cooperative and competitive. We help each other, 
by talking to each other. That is cooperation. But someone gets more out of the 
conversation than the other person. That is competition.
<p>
Conversation is similar to buying something. The buyer is happy because he/she 
has the thing they wanted. The seller is happy because he/she has the money. 
That is cooperation. But who got the best of the bargain? Who won?
<p>
<h2>Classwork</h2>
I want to make this course a conversation competition. Each week everyone will 
have a conversation with a partner about some sound file they have listened to 
for homework.
<p>
<h3>This is how it will work:</h3>
<p>
The 2 partners will each get a card with different information about the 
subject of the sound file. They then discuss their information and the 
information of their partner, asking each other questions and answering them 
for 2-5 minutes. The teacher then finds out who understands the situation 
better by giving the 2 persons independently a quiz composed of 9-10 questions. 
The person who gets more questions correct is the winner, the other is the 
loser. If they both get the same number of questions correct, it is a draw.
<p>
Each week, after that pairwork activity, students in groups of 4 will discuss 
the same information that they discussed in groups of 2. I will put the 
same/similar information on 4 separate cards. They will try to work out what 
the correct answers to the quiz questions were. This group discussion will not 
be competitive.
<p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
In fact in Weeks 4, 9 (ie Midterm Week), 13 and 18 (ie Finals Week), this 
cooperative activity will be an exam, a group exam. Your aim is to make sure 
that everyone in your group understands the separate information you each have. 
Your score is your 3 partners' score.
<p>
We are doing 4 of these exams. Students in previous semesters have found them 
quite difficult. But they do not contribute very much to the final grade. Each 
exam is worth only 4 points, for a total of 16 points.
<p>
The pairwork discussions in class are more important. They are worth 3 points 
for a loss, 4 points for a draw and 5 points for a win, for a total over the 14 
classes of the semester of 70 points.
<p>
<h2>Homework</h2>
The other 15 points is for listening homework. The homework will involve 
listening to a sound file, writing down the words you hear, and answering some 
questions. If you can write down most of the letters and answer the question, 
you get one point. This will prepare you for the discussion in class.
<p>
As you can see, the most important part of the grade is the pair discussions in 
class. In fact, if you don't win any of the discussions, your grade is a 
maximum of 72. In addition, if you don't do well in the exams (which is likely 
because they are very difficult), and if you miss a few classes, you are in 
danger of failing.
<p>
<h2>Make-up policy</h2>
No MAKE-UP classes, exams, or homework. Each activity is worth only a small percentage of the total grade. It's important that you be there for every activity, but each absence only changes your grade a little.
