  \item [Discussion] Two people will each have a card with different information. They will discuss their information. They will try to understand what is on the other person's card and how it is connected to their own information. The teacher doesn't want you to use Chinese. \textbf{No Chinese}. The teacher doesn't want you to show your card to your partner. \textbf{No looking at partner's card}.
  \item [Rules] 
    \begin{description}
      \item Tell the truth
      \item Give information the other person needs
      \item Don't give unnecessary information. Stay on topic
      \item Be clear and easy to understand
      \item Be brief and organized
      \item Be friendly and polite
    \end{description}
  \item [Quiz] The teacher will then give both students 8-9 questions about the two cards. The person who gets most questions correct is the winner and gets 5 points. the other person (the loser) gets 3 points. If both get the same number of questions correct, they both get 4 points. Players who are absent get 0.
  \item [Next week] The discussion will be about some old people who were unhappy because they were expecting to listen to someone playing the piano, but instead a piano tuner was tuning the piano. So they couldn't have any music.
      \end{description}
A: Dr Bean wants you to have a conversation, but he doesn't want you to use Chinese or show your cards to each other. After the conversation, you will do a quiz to see who understands more. The person with most questions gets 5, the other 3. If both get the same number, they get 4 each.
B: The rules of conversation are: 1. Tell the truth. 2. Be informative. If you know the answer to your partner's question, tell your partner. 3. Be clear and easy to understand. Make sure your partner understands you. 4. Be brief and organized. 5. Be friendly and polite.
C: Classwork discussions will be 14 x 5 = 70\% of the grade, homework, 18 x 1 = 15\%, exams 4 x 4 = 15\%. There will be no make-up work.
D: The exams will be a discussion by the four people in each group of one of the stories you listened to for homework. Unlike the classwork, they will be cooperative, rather than competitive. However it will be difficult to get a good score.

  \begin{Large}Information about the grading\end{Large}
  \normalsize
  \begin{description}
  \item [Classwork] Each week, there will be a discussion based on the homework. These discussions will be seventy (70) percent of the grade.
  \item [Homework] will be fifteen (15) percent of the grade. Each week, you will have to listen to a sound file on the Internet. If you can write down many of the words that you hear, you will get one (1) point. If you write down only a very few, you will get zero (0) points. This week's homework is about a piano tuner tuning a piano at an old people's home.
  \item [Exams] will be sixteen (16) percent of the grade.
  There will be exams in weeks 4, 9, 13, and 18, each worth 4 points each. They will be a discussion by four (4) students. Each student will have information about part of the subject. They will have to share their information and work out how it is all related. All four students will all get the same grade (0-4) for the exam. The discussion is \textbf{cooperative}, not \textbf{competitive}. However, in these exams it is very difficult to get a high grade,
  \item [Make-up] There are no 'make up' activities. If you are absent for a class discussion or an exam, you cannot do it in a later week. Each week, you earn 4-5 points to your grade. This is a significant amount, but not a lot. Being in class is important.
