        \item [The job]
          Ed Trinka worked as a doorman at the Plaza Hotel, a very old and very 
          famous hotel in New York. His job was to greet guests as they came into 
          the hotel, help them get out of their cars, and help them with their 
          bags. This was very simple to do.
        \item [Making guests feel important]
          But he also had to do something 
          which was more difficult to do. That was the job of making guests feel 
          important and happy about staying at the Plaza. Ed did a very good job of 
          this, because he was a happy and friendly person.
          \indent He didn't do this 
          because it was his job. He did it because he liked 
          people. And he did it because his father told him to try and be the sort of person who would make the world a perfect place.
        \item [Shoe shine story]
          One time, a guest wanted his shoes shined very early in the 
          morning, before the shoe shine stand was open, so he shone the shoes 
          himself, not because it was his job, but because Ed just wanted 
          to help.    He just made people around him feel happy, even when they 
          weren't very happy before seeing him.
        \item [Family]
          Ed met his wife at the Plaza Hotel. She was working there as a maid. They had two sons. She died three years ago. He misses her. He is looking for another wife.
        \item [Retirement]
          Ed retired in March, 2009. He was 65. The Plaza Hotel gave him a big retirement party. A famous TV host and financial expert helped him organize his retirement. Now he is planning to write a book about being a doorman.

        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [New York] New York is a big city and people there usually aren't very friendly or polite because they are too busy in their own lives to think about other people.
        \item [Debra Goodman] Debra Goodman walked to work past the Plaza Hotel every day. Ed was friendly to her. 'Good morning, young lady. Nice day.' She became a friend. Ed had many, many friends like this. They were people he met while he was working. Some were guests at the hotel. Some were passers-by.
        \item [Jackie Gleason] Jackie Gleason was a famous comedian. He was not a happy person, even though he made other people laugh. Ed used to make him feel happy, so he gave Ed very big tips. Jackie Gleason made a lot of money, but he liked to spend it at expensive hotels like the Plaza Hotel.
        \item [Mary--his wife] Mary loved him because he was the same at home as he was at work. Always happy, always friendly, always willing to help.
        \item [Famous people] He keeps a picture book of photographs of him with famous people. It is full of the most famous Americans, movies stars, singers, politicians, basketball players, baseball players. He has their pictures. But they also asked him to sign pictures of himself that they could keep.
        \item [Retirement party]
          The owner of the Plaza Hotel was there. The manager of the hotel was there. The mayor of New York also appeared. The major New York newspapers and a TV station sent reporters to the party.
