# Exam debriefing--review, wrap-up and feedback

## Stories only loosely connected to the stories Dr Bean showed

I was disappointed with the headlines, questions and lead paragraphs.

Some students did a good job.

Most students 

- made up stories not connected to the headline, or 

(You must listen very carefully to what Dr Bean says about the stories. You _must_ understand the story. You can make up the details but you can't make up the story.)

## Very short stories

- wrote very little, or 

(This was not so much a problem)

## Not news

- didn't write about an event that happened at one point in time, at one particular place on the earth.
- wrote about their friends. This is not something anyone else wants to read on the Internet or in a newspaper.

It has to be new, that is something that has _happened recently._ And it has to be _newsworthy_, ie suitable to be printed for everyone to read, because it is interesting.

How is your friends' pillow fight different than other people's pillow fights?

## Questions for the reader, rather than questions about the event

Any question with "you" in it, is not an interesting question about a news story. Who does "you" refer to? The writer or readers?

## Spread-out lead paragraph

Not,

A woman threw garbage over a cliff. The cliff was 60 meters high. She fell down the cliff. She waited 3 days before she was rescued.

Instead,

A woman who had fallen down a 60-meter-high cliff when throwing garbage over it waited 3 days before being rescued Monday.

A SUBJECT, who/which OLD NEWS (or EARLIER EVENT, OTHER INFORMATION) MAIN/NEW NEWS

Modify the SUBJECT with adjectives as you can.

# Good, bad examples

## Good lead paragraph, bad lead paragraph

- The polar bear can endure the cold, because it has a strong body.
- A polar bear was discovered in a home in Alaska. It maybe was hungry.

## Good headlines, bad headlines

- Bank robber waited for police to arrest him
- Horse walks into police station

## Good/bad time references in lead

- 10:00, this morning
- one day

## Indefinite/definite articles in lead

- Kobe James, the owner of the world's heaviest pumpkin, says the pumpkin weighs 2500 pounds.
- A Kentucky man has harvested a pumpkin weighing 2500 pounds, making it the world's heaviest.

## Students who plagiarized published news articles in the exam:

- Owen
- Jessica
- Sandy1
