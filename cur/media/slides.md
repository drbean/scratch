# Headline grammar

## Headline passives. No "was/is"

Xi didn't call Eleven. The _newscaster_ called Xi Eleven. Xi WAS called Eleven.

The dog didn't find on West Coast. Someone found the dog on the West Coast. The dog WAS found.

The car didn't return. The car WAS returned.

## Headline tense. No past tense. Present tense.

Man USES banana.

Singer TRIES to kiss reporter.

## Headline word order. The important word is not used until the end.

Tension is built by keeping back the most important word until the end of the line.

Headline: Da de da de da. Boom!

Reader: What!?! I must read this story, because I have so many questions.
