# Headline grammar

## Headline passives. No "was/is"

Xi didn't call Eleven. Xi WAS called Eleven.

The dog didn't find on West Coast. The dog WAS found.

The car didn't return. The car WAS returned.

## Headline tense. No past tense. Present tense.

Man USES banana.

Singer TRIES to kiss reporter.

## Headline word order. The important word is not used until the end.

Tension is built by keeping back the most important word until the end of the line.

Headline: Da de da de da. Boom!

Reader: What!?! I must read this story, because I have so many questions.
