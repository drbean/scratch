# Headline grammar

## Headline passives. No "was/is"

Xi didn't call Eleven. Xi WAS called Eleven.

The dog didn't find on West Coast. The dog WAS found.

The car didn't return. The car WAS returned.

## Headline tense. No past tense. Present tense.

Man USES banana.

Singer TRIES to kiss reporter.

## Headline word order. The important word is not used until the end.

Tension is built by keeping back the most important word until the end of the line.

Headline: Da de da de da. Boom!

Reader: What!?! I must read this story, because I have so many questions.

## Exam results

I was disappointed with the headlines, questions and lead paragraphs.

Some students did a good job.

Other students 

- made up stories not connected to the headline, or 
- wrote very little, or 
- didn't write about an event that happened at one point in time, at one particular place on the earth.

## Good lead paragraph, bad lead paragraph

- The polar bear can endure the cold, because it has a strong body.
- A polar bear was discovered in a home in Alaska. It maybe was hungry.

## Good headlines, bad headlines

- Bank robber waited for police to arrest him
- Horse walks into police station

## Good/bad time references in lead

- 10:00, this morning
- one day

## Indefinite/definite articles in lead

- Kobe James, the owner of the world's heaviest pumpkin, says the pumpkin weighs 2500 pounds.
- A Kentucky man has harvested a pumpkin weighing 2500 pounds, making it the world's heaviest.
