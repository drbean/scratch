# Midterm Exam

## Exam results

I was happier with the headlines, questions and lead paragraphs than in Week 5.

But no students did a really good job.

Only a few students wrote stories that were not the story I gave you.

But the lead sentences were not well composed.

## Plagiarism

## Students who plagiarized published news articles in the exam:

- Elena
- Kitty

## Consequences of plagiarism

## Dr Bean's keywords are not headlines.

Take note: Stephanie, Jessica. 

- Headlines should have a verb.
- The same verb will be used again as the main verb in the first sentence.

Good/bad lead paragraphs

One silent night, Mr Wang heard a puppy barking on his roof. He followed the sound and finally found the puppy on the roof's back left corner. He was anxious and called 119 for help.


On Nov. 11, 2014, a dog was rescued from the roof of a house after 3 days without food or water.

## Interesting questions

They must be questions that you think of after seeing the headline, not questions that you think of after reading the story.

Questions which are answered in your lead sentence are probably not interesting questions.

- Who: John Doe, Jr, 3 years old, Lyle Bloom (Sanitation Engineer for the Water Resources Department)
