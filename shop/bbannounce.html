<h1>Book swap shop</h1>

I have set up a web site to help you get a second-hand copy of the textbook we are using in this class.
<br>
The URL is <a href="http://e_learning.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/shop/script_files/shop_cgi.pl/">http://e_learning.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/shop/script_files/shop_cgi.pl/</a>.
<br>
You can put your name in a database of people looking for the book. And you can search the database of old students who have a copy of the book, and who want to sell it.
