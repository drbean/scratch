Subject: Selling old textbook to new student

Hi. Are you keeping in touch with English?

Last semester we used a text book in our classes.

This semester I am using the same book in other
classes. And I would like you to sell your old book
to my new students, by going to my Swap Shop web site,
http://e_learning.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/shop/script_files/shop_cgi.pl/
and either registering your contact details on the
sellers list or browsing the buyers list of contact
numbers of people looking for the book.

Try the site out. There are no buyers there at the 
moment, but I will announce the site in class next 
week, so there should be some people looking for 
the book there in the first few weeks of the 
semester.

What do you think is a reasonable price to ask for the book?

I've forgotten how much the book was.

If it didn't have the CD, you would ask less. If 
it were in very good condition, like-new, then you 
could ask for more.

Anyway, try going to the web site, and having a look.
I enjoyed writing the web site, and I would like it
to get used.

You can delete your entry.  There's a message 
which will be displayed.  It says to check your 
email and to click on a link in an email from me. 
So, do that, and you will be delisted. This is to 
prevent people deleting entries which are not 
theirs.
