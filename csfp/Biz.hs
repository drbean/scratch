And my parents, my mom, I remember calling my mom and telling her I'm going to start this company and she says, you know, What do you guys do, and I said, We build these things called 3-D graphics, chips, and people will use them to play games. And she said, Why don't you go get a job? And so, I umm...\n"

We grew up in the video game generation. I was the video game generation. I was the beginning of the video game generation. And so the entertainment value of video games, computer games was very obvious to me. And I could imagine how it could be a very large market, and a very large industry. For a lot of the people that were older, that sensibility didn't exist. And so, notice ...\n"

It is apparently true. And yet at the time, our common sense was unique. Nobody would have created the technology, nobody would have created the company with the sole purpose of building technology to make video games possible. And so that was our perspective. Now we felt that that video games would, would of course fuel the technology development but you could use this technology for a whole bunch of other reasons.\n"
