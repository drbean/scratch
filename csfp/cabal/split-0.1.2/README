Data.List.Split provides a wide range of strategies and a unified
combinator framework for splitting lists with respect to some sort of
delimiter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:

  There are no dependencies other than the base package.
  Data.List.Split has been tested with GHC 6.8.3 and 6.10.1, but it
  will likely work with older versions of GHC and other Haskell
  compilers as well.

  The Properties.hs file depends on QuickCheck >= 2.1, but you don't
  need it in order to build the library.


Build with Cabal:

    cabal install --prefix=$HOME --user

  Or, if you don't have the 'cabal' tool:
    
    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  (Optionally, you can omit the --prefix and --user arguments to the
  configure step, and run the install step with 'sudo' in order to
  install the library systemwide.)


Building Haddock documentation (recommended):

    runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock

  Once the documentation has been built, you can access it by 
  pointing your browser to dist/doc/html/split/index.html.
