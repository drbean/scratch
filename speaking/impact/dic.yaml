  - False impressions on men afraid of smart women

    Sara: Two girls were talking. And then a cute guy came by. And then, he was talking. But one girl pretended that she was, wasn't smart.

    Well, I think that intelligence is sexy in a woman. And, um, changing yourself is, um, definitely wrong. I do have, like, many friends who do that all the time. But it is really easy to get a date. It is. But the problem is that they date that person and they realize that it was the wrong man. And they finally just break up. And, um, and it's because they pretended they were a different person. If you want the right man, you have to be yourself.

    Hi. This is Richard. Let's look at Unit 2. Traffic Jam. In Unit 2, the focus is on traffic, what happens when there are too many vehicles on the road. In big cities all over the world--Seoul, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, New York, London, Sao Paolo--there is a flood of cars, trucks, buses on the streets. The result is a big mess, a big jam.

    There are some cities such as Singapore and London that have done some very innovative things to try to solve the traffic problem. Unfortunately, many cities have not done anything. Here are some very interesting questions that come out of this unit.

    What are some solutions to traffic problems? What can we do? Is there anything we can do? Why do people use cars? Are there alternative forms of transportation to driving cars? Are there anything that governments can do to solve these problems?

    Now when you start teaching this unit, there are some things that you might want to think about before you begin. A lot of people think that owning a car and driving a car is a status symbol, that is, it shows that they have money, that they are important people. And they would really hate to give up driving a car.

    And when it comes right down to it, people maybe don't care so much about the environment as they should, when they have a car. They think it's very convenient, and it takes them to where they want to go.

    Ah, some difficult issues to face in this, but with the cost of oil going up and up and up, this is an important issue. I hope your students enjoy it.

    Scott: Well, the situation is that we have two people working in a company abroad. And, uh, one of them feels that it's important to learn the local language. And the other one thinks that, because the company, uh, works, uh, speaks in English, that it is OK not to learn the language. And, uh the tensions around that issue.

    I think that if you go anywhere to live for an extended period of time, you need to make the effort to learn that local language. I think it shows a lot about your willingness to learn about the culture, and I pretty much can guarantee that if you take the time to learn that language, the people around you, whether or not they speak English or not, will respect you more. That has been my experience in living in Japan, so I would urge all people to do that. If you've lived in a place for only one year or something like that, there's no way you can help it, but after four years or so, there's no excuse not to try.

    Richard Day: Aloha. This is Richard. I'd like to talk to you about Unit 11, An International Relationship. Akane is in Paris. She's writing an email to her best friend, Mari, who is in Japan. Akane is at a college in Paris and she's almost finished. But there's a problem. She has a boyfriend, Lukus. He lives in Finland. She really doesn't like Finland. When she's been there, she complained about it. She thought it was not a nice place to live. And the language was hard. Very difficult.

    Lukus doesn't want to live in Japan. Aha, here's a problem. And also, there's the parents. You know, her parents aren't really happy about her living in Europe any more. She's been there and she, she .. they want her to come back.

    What should she do? Aha, this is a great question. It involves what it takes to make an international relationship successful. Then it also looks at the bigger question, How about any relationship? How about any sort of situation between a man and a woman? What should we do? Very, very difficult. Um, what should Akane do? She doesn't want to break up with him, with, with Lukus. But they don't have a place to live.

    Now when you teach this unit, you might want to keep in mind that not all of your students have really given any thought of living abroad, much less falling in love with someone from another country. In addition, students might be reluctant to share their ideas about possible problems in a relationship, even one in their own country. 
    Gillian: Okay. this situation is about a decision a college student, a young woman, has to make as to whether to follow her boyfriend to Finland after university, or to go her own way.
        Well, what I think is that, um, all young people, but I would say particularly women, um, given the role, the idea that a woman has to find a man--that is often an idea in our society--given that, I think women particularly, but all young people should get experience, life experience. So I would recommend anyone graduating from college, um, travel a little, have work experience in different places, even take on different jobs. I would not recommend that people rush into a committed relationship, or even get married that young. But it depends on the person, of course.

        Um, I have a friend who had a very close intimate relationship with her boyfriend at university. When graduation came around, they decided to go different ways, but they kept in touch. My friend went to the States, from England, for two years, met many different people, had different experiences. At the end of two years, met up with her boyfriend again, and then they decided, yep, they'd had experiences, they wanted to be together. Don't rush things.

    Steve: The situation is that there are two guys. It sounds like they are college students. And they are talking together. And, one of the guys is unhappy, because someone, he heard from somebody, that there's a rumor that he, he's gay. And he said, it's not true. 

    Well I think that, um, unfortunately, people are people. No matter where you are, whatever country you're in, someone will gossip about somebody. I don't know why it happens, but it, it does. About this situation, I had a similar situation happen to me, unfortunately. Um, in the early days of computers, um, the Internet was just coming in, and I'd left my Internet open without closing it, and I, I'd forgotten to do that. I didn't realize at the time. And, um, someone sent a friend of mine an email saying that I wanted to go out with him.

    And, uh, he came to me a few days later and said, "Steve, I'm not like that!" And I said, "What do you mean?" I had no idea what he was talking about. And, uh, he didn't tell me, and I thought--I was confused! And then a day later or two days later, he came up to me and he confessed what he, what was, that I'd sent him an email.  And I said, no, I hadn't! And, basically, to be honest, he still didn't believe me.

    Todd: The situation is, the government has a plan to control the population. Their idea is to make childless couples pay a fine and give that money to couples with children, because it costs quite a bit of money to raise children.

    This is a very interesting idea. Many countries have a population problem. Other countries don't have enough people. They have aging societies. So trying to regulate this seems like it might be a good idea.

    I am in favor of the government giving some money when children are born because children do cost so much money. And in developed countries there seems to be a problem with the aging society--not having enough children. Now in other countries there are too many children, but I'm not in favor of the government telling them that they must not have children. Advising, yes, but not telling them.

    So as far as fining childless couples, I think the government goes too far there. So I think the government has to strike the right balance to encourage those countries that need more children to have children to encourage the country that have, the countries that have too many children not to have children. But to, to make them pay fines for this, it's going overboard a bit.
