    Sara: Two girls were talking. And then a cute guy came by. And then, he was talking. But one girl pretended that she was, wasn't smart.

    Well, I think that intelligence is sexy in a woman. And, um, changing yourself is, um, definitely wrong. I do have, like, many friends who do that all the time. But it is really easy to get a date. It is. But the problem is that they date that person and they realize that it was the wrong man. And they finally just break up. And, um, and it's because they pretended they were a different person. If you want the right man, you have to be yourself.

    Hi. This is Richard. Let's look at Unit 2. Traffic Jam. In Unit 2, the focus is on traffic, what happens when there are too many vehicles on the road. In big cities all over the world--Seoul, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, New York, London, Sao Paolo--there is a flood of cars, trucks, buses on the streets. The result is a big mess, a big jam.

    There are some cities such as Singapore and London that have done some very innovative things to try to solve the traffic problem. Unfortunately, many cities have not done anything. Here are some very interesting questions that come out of this unit.

    What are some solutions to traffic problems? What can we do? Is there anything we can do? Why do people use cars? Are there alternative forms of transportation to driving cars? Are there anything that governments can do to solve these problems?

    Now when you start teaching this unit, there are some things that you might want to think about before you begin. A lot of people think that owning a car and driving a car is a status symbol, that is, it shows that they have money, that they are important people. And they would really hate to give up driving a car.

    And when it comes right down to it, people maybe don't care so much about the environment as they should, when they have a car. They think it's very convenient, and it takes them to where they want to go.

    Ah, some difficult issues to face in this, but with the cost of oil going up and up and up, this is an important issue. I hope your students enjoy it.

    Scott: Well, the situation is that we have two people working in a company abroad. And, uh, one of them feels that it's important to learn the local language. And the other one thinks that, because the company, uh, works, uh, speaks in English, that it is OK not to learn the language. And, uh the tensions around that issue.

    I think that if you go anywhere to live for an extended period of time, you need to make the effort to learn that local language. I think it shows a lot about your willingness to learn about the culture, and I pretty much can guarantee that if you take the time to learn that language, the people around you, whether or not they speak English or not, will respect you more. That has been my experience in living in Japan, so I would urge all people to do that. If you've lived in a place for only one year or something like that, there's no way you can help it, but after four years or so, there's no excuse not to try.

    Richard Day: Aloha. This is Richard. I'd like to talk to you about Unit 11, An International Relationship. Akane is in Paris. She's writing an email to her best friend, Mari, who is in Japan. Akane is at a college in Paris and she's almost finished. But there's a problem. She has a boyfriend, Lukus. He lives in Finland. She really doesn't like Finland. When she's been there, she complained about it. She thought it was not a nice place to live. And the language was hard. Very difficult.

    Lukus doesn't want to live in Japan. Aha, here's a problem. And also, there's the parents. You know, her parents aren't really happy about her living in Europe any more. She's been there and she, she .. they want her to come back.

    What should she do? Aha, this is a great question. It involves what it takes to make an international relationship successful. Then it also looks at the bigger question, How about any relationship? How about any sort of situation between a man and a woman? What should we do? Very, very difficult. Um, what should Akane do? She doesn't want to break up with him, with, with Lukus. But they don't have a place to live.

    Now when you teach this unit, you might want to keep in mind that not all of your students have really given any thought of living abroad, much less falling in love with someone from another country. In addition, students might be reluctant to share their ideas about possible problems in a relationship, even one in their own country. 
    Gillian: Okay. this situation is about a decision a college student, a young woman, has to make as to whether to follow her boyfriend to Finland after university, or to go her own way.
        Well, what I think is that, um, all young people, but I would say particularly women, um, given the role, the idea that a woman has to find a man--that is often an idea in our society--given that, I think women particularly, but all young people should get experience, life experience. So I would recommend anyone graduating from college, um, travel a little, have work experience in different places, even take on different jobs. I would not recommend that people rush into a committed relationship, or even get married that young. But it depends on the person, of course.

        Um, I have a friend who had a very close intimate relationship with her boyfriend at university. When graduation came around, they decided to go different ways, but they kept in touch. My friend went to the States, from England, for two years, met many different people, had different experiences. At the end of two years, met up with her boyfriend again, and then they decided, yep, they'd had experiences, they wanted to be together. Don't rush things.

    Steve: The situation is that there are two guys. It sounds like they are college students. And they are talking together. And, one of the guys is unhappy, because someone, he heard from somebody, that there's a rumor that he, he's gay. And he said, it's not true. 

    Well I think that, um, unfortunately, people are people. No matter where you are, whatever country you're in, someone will gossip about somebody. I don't know why it happens, but it, it does. About this situation, I had a similar situation happen to me, unfortunately. Um, in the early days of computers, um, the Internet was just coming in, and I'd left my Internet open without closing it, and I, I'd forgotten to do that. I didn't realize at the time. And, um, someone sent a friend of mine an email saying that I wanted to go out with him.

    And, uh, he came to me a few days later and said, "Steve, I'm not like that!" And I said, "What do you mean?" I had no idea what he was talking about. And, uh, he didn't tell me, and I thought--I was confused! And then a day later or two days later, he came up to me and he confessed what he, what was, that I'd sent him an email.  And I said, no, I hadn't! And, basically, to be honest, he still didn't believe me.

    Todd: The situation is, the government has a plan to control the population. Their idea is to make childless couples pay a fine and give that money to couples with children, because it costs quite a bit of money to raise children.

    This is a very interesting idea. Many countries have a population problem. Other countries don't have enough people. They have aging societies. So trying to regulate this seems like it might be a good idea.

    I am in favor of the government giving some money when children are born because children do cost so much money. And in developed countries there seems to be a problem with the aging society--not having enough children. Now in other countries there are too many children, but I'm not in favor of the government telling them that they must not have children. Advising, yes, but not telling them.

    So as far as fining childless couples, I think the government goes too far there. So I think the government has to strike the right balance to encourage those countries that need more children to have children to encourage the country that have, the countries that have too many children not to have children. But to, to make them pay fines for this, it's going overboard a bit.

    Derek: The situation is about changing times. In this case, whether or not to live with your significant other. like girlfriend or boyfriend, before marriage.

    Cohabitation, before marriage? Really, it's up to the individuals who are involved in the relationship. Obviously, society, and ultimately parents, do have an opinion about such issues. But still it's up to those two who want, the two people who want to take their relationship to the next step, but maybe do not feel that they're ready for that larger commitment. So really it's another stage of the relationship--cohabitation.  The parents may have dissatisfaction, but they need to understand that their children are growing up in an era different from their own, that the value systems have changed. And so for two people to get together, to live together before marriage, could open the doors for them to explore their relationships better and to ultimately avoid making a mistake in a, especially in societies where the divorce rates are at fifty percent.

    Junko: Hello, this is Junko. I'd like to talk about Unit 16, Size discrimination. In this unit, a woman who is overweight decides to accept her body. Alicia used to hate her body. She was always on a diet and afraid to talk to guys. However, one day she attended a meeting held by an organization that fights size discrimination. And since that time, she has been confident about herself. She has accepted her body and she's feeling happy.

    A lot of people worry about being overweight. How much does our weight affect our health and happiness? Should it? There's some questions raised: Do you feel people are too worried about their weight? Do you think too many people are on diets? Is being slim always good? Another issue is that, Is there such a thing as size discrimination in your country? People who are over, overweight are like made fun of, or that kind of thing? How about at school? How about at work? And how do people feel about it? Is looking good always important? Or are other good qualities more important than looks or size?

    Here's some things to keep in mind. This is a rather sensitive issue. Many students, especially girls, feel they are overweight, even if they are not. And sometimes it's really amazing, you know, surprising, that some girls who are rather slim feel that they are overweight. Sometimes I can't believe that they feel that way. But, you know, these students, these students, and those who are really overweight might feel uncomfortable talking about this topic. 

    'Kay? Another thing to keep in mind is that teachers and students might not feel comfortable using the word, "fat." So in that case, I advise you to use "heavy," or "overweight." 'Kay. I hope your students get a lot out of this unit.

    Andrea: After dieting on and off for quite some time, the young woman decides that she's going to be satisfied with her physical appearance, and accept that being healthy is the way to be, no matter what her body looks like.

    As much as we're told that beauty is having this kind of hair style or wearing these kind of clothes, I, I fully believe that the real root of beauty lies within self-confidence. And that once you have that, your, your general physical appearance is going to match that psychological appearance that you have. And if you really think about it, the most beautiful people you know are those people that kind of exude self-confidence and believe in themselves.

    And for this reason I think that the young woman in this scenario is going to, even though she may not be changing, she will be, people will see her in a different light because she believes a different thing about the, herself. And that's that she is, she is who she is, and she's not dissatisfied with that. She's OK with that. And I think that's the secret to success.

  - Who will help refugees?
  - speaking

    Richard: Aloha. this is Richard. Let's look at Unit 17, Who will help them? The 'them' in the title of this unit means refugees. Specifically, it begins with the concern over how to help refugees. A young man, a university student has just heard an announcement that his country's prime minister is planning to give a large amount of money to help African refugees.

    Shen is concerned that they don't need their help. He wonders why his country should give a lot of money to help starving, homeless refugees in Africa. He believes that the United Nations should help. And maybe other countries in Africa should help. He's concerned that the money will go to other people when there are problems in his own country.

    The issue then, focuses initially on who should help refugees. Should the government of one country help another country's refugees? The broader issue is how might some of our serious problems in the world be addressed. Whose responsibility are these problems?

    Now when you teach this issue, you might consider that your students might have a little awareness. They might not know much about the plight of refugees throughout the world. Some students might not even understand that a number of different events, not only natural disasters, such as tsunami, can cause people to become refugees.

    Justin: The issue here is, Should governments of rich countries spend lots of money helping people in poor countries. Or should they focus on problems inside their own countries.
    
     I think the issue here is really, ah, what is the alternative to helping? Ah, yes we have to look after ourselves, we have to look after our family, we have to look after our friends. If we're a government, we have to look after our people. But let's just think about this. Imagine you have a choice. Your choice is, you can help someone or you can refuse to help someone. Can you sleep at night having made the, the choice not to help them? I think not. And I think governments are really just an extension of individuals. And I think governments also need to sleep well at night. Therefore, I think, although we would like to keep all the money to help, to help ourselves, I think it's very important to be kind, generous, and to, to help others, just as perhaps one day we will need help, too.

    Mei: The issue is the pros and cons of introduced marriage and love marriage.

    I think introduced marriage is a safe way to meet someone. It's also a good way to meet someone. Um, when I was young I thought it's very unromantic. But now I think it's a good idea because I have a friend who was introduced to her husband from her parents and she didn't know him at all. But, um, they married right away and they've been married for almost ten years and they look very happy. They have two children, she, she's, she has many hobbies that her husband supports and they, I feel, I think that they love each other, too. And that marriage is also good but there's no guarantee that you can be in love forever, and it doesn't mean that if you, if you love each other, you can be really happy to be together, so I think, I still think a love marriage is good, but introduced marriage is also good.

    Sara: A mother is complaining to a high school principal that her daughter's, she's .. her teacher dresses quite extreme. And it's bad for education.
    
    Um, I would, I would love to have a stylish teacher. And it's because when I was high school, I, we all had to wear, um, dark colors uniforms and then the teachers wore really simple clothes. And it was, we found it quite boring.

    I think that the way people dress is an expression of who they are. And I think that the students want to know who their teachers are. Some of the subjects in high school are not so interesting, but I think if you know the teacher well, it would help the students, um, become more interested in that subject

    Richard Day: Aloha. This is Richard. I'm going to look at Unit 20, A Mother's Story. I love the way this story begins. Let me read it to you. "My heart jumped with joy when he was dead. I knew then, when the electricity was sent into that man's body, that I would finally have peace." Thlat's a real gripping beginning. And this takes us into a mother's story about her son, who was killed needlessly, senselessly, in a robbery. She wants the murderer, the robber, to die for his crime. Ooh, this is a very powerful story. And it raises a number of very, very deep and emotional questions. Is capital punishment an appropriate punishment for murder? Should our government kill people? Another issue that's really important is one of the justifications that we hear for capital punishment, that capital punishment prevents people from killing other people. Is this true? Another good issue is, Is the death penalty ever the right sentence? What is someone kills a policeman who is trying to prevent a robbery? Should that person be killed by the state? Some very, very difficult questions. Sometimes, they're very hard to answer.

    Now I would suggest that when you teach this, you keep in mind that it is an emotional issue. It can provoke strong feelings. And also discussions of death penalty often get into religion, and culture. Good luck with this very interesting unit.
    
    Scott: The situation is that a mother whose child was murdered is talking about the death penalty. And the fact that she actually saw the man who killed her son die by the death penalty. And how that made her feel.

    Well, you see, the woman said that it made her feel better that she saw him die, but actually in my opinion, and also studies have shown, that even when families who have had that happen actually watched that they may in the short term feel good but the long term effects aren't good. You're not actually psychologically prepared to deal with that either. Um, so I don't approve of the death penalty.

    Ah, generally, I don't think that a life for a life makes sense. The state is just as barbaric if you do that. And then also from the psychological point of view of those who were' ah, done wrong by the killing, um, in the end, it doesn't make anyone feel good. So I don't agree with the mother's stance that watching someone be killed watching someone die, is a good thing.

    Sara: A girl is going to get cosmetic surgery. And she's saving up for it. But her mother is against it, because she thinks she's beautiful enough.
    
    I am in favor of cosmetic surgery. I understand that parents are against cosmetic surgery because you're rejecting their DNA and it also seems like you're rejecting your parents. And changing the way you look like is not how you were naturally born and that would be heartbreaking for them. And in my country there were so many girls who had cosmetic surgery and it was quite natural. They just went to the clinic and one hour later they get big eyes and it was really beautiful. They looked so confident and really happy. So it was really, really popular. And first, it's the eyes, and then it's the nose, and other parts. But, yeah, yes, I think plastic surgery makes many people happy.
