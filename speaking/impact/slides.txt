She was friendly.

## Learned about her later

She was shy, not confident.
She was not intelligent, but had a good EQ.
She was supportive, kind.

## What do you think about first impressions?

Abena:	I would never change how I act to make an impression.
	That's stupid.

Jin-Sook:	People just care about looks. It's too bad people have 
	to look good to impress someone.

Manosh:	Pretending to be someone you are not is sexy. People
		should act different to impress.

Nazim:	People should hide what they really think about themselves.
	Men, in particular, like to feel they are superior to other people.
	They should not show what they feel.

## What do YOU think about first impressions?


Abena:	I would never change how I act in front of men.
	That's stupid

## Using mind maps

Useful when preparing a speech or an essay by brainstorming

You do one mind map.

		- 2 points for 1-2 features
		- 3 points for 8 features

I will collect them.

Your score is the average of all the scores of the members of your group.

- Help the other members of your group.
- Tell them what kind of person they are.

Is it OK for a woman to go on a date for money?

[Gillian says it is OK.](http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/3_8.mov)

I don't think it is good for a woman to have sex for money.

- The work environment (ie people, work conditions) sex workers have to work in isn't good.

- ['The Hills are Alive' - The Sound of Music](URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbQSAdU4Qb4)

## Extinct/protected species in Taiwan

- [Extinct animals in taiwan - Google](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=extinct+animals+taiwan&num=100)
- [List of protected species in Taiwan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ](http://www.google.com.tw/url?q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protected_species_in_Taiwan)
- [List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene (last 11,700 years) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_animals_extinct_in_the_Holocene)

## What is environmental pollution

The city is dirty. The mountains are clean.

But dirt is not environmental pollution and there might be water pollution in clean mountains.

## Your experience of environmental pollution

What kinds of environmental pollution are there? Is climate change, eg temperature change, an example of pollution?

What examples of environmental pollution have you experienced personally?
Have you gotten sick or felt bad because of environmental pollution?

## Organic products

Your experience with organic products when you go shopping?

Do you seek out organic products when you go shopping?

What products are treated with chemicals or have chemicals added to them?

Why are these chemicals used?

What effects do these chemicals have on you, or on the environment?

Do you think farmers should use less agricultural chemicals?

## The future and what should be done

Are you worried?

Do you think it's possible that every person might die out and homo sapiens become extinct like the Formosan shadowed leopard?

Yesterday, the Formosan shadowed leopard. Tomorrow, you and/or your descendants.

It will not be an easy death.

There are 2 groups. Those who think drastic action is necessary.
And the other which thinks the first group is exaggerating.

Which group do you belong to?

## Points of view--Rich countries, like Taiwan, have to take drastic action

- [Kyoto Protocol](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=kyoto+protocol&num=100)
- [Carbon tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax)

Taiwan is a rich (or a richer) country

Who calls for drastic action?

On what point do Nazim and Francesca agree?

Who is optimistic? Who is pessimistic?

# Aliens

## What does 'alien' mean?

- (Adjective) Foreign, or from some other place/origin & not nice, eg Alien Registration Card. Thus, [ARC](http://images.google.com/images?q=%22alien%20registration%20card%22&num=100)
- (Noun) A being from outer space, ie ET, an Extra-Terrestrial

## Independence Day: The Movie

- [Aliens attack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nahdy9SjbGs)
- [Trailer (not the real one)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YtvsxB9xQY)
- [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film))

## Warm-up questions (from Communication Strategies)

- Do you think there is intelligent life on other planets?
- Do you think aliens have visited the earth in UFOs?
- If aliens visit the earth in big numbers, will they be friendly or aggressive?
- Do you think aliens could be living among us now?

## the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence

- The universe is vast (infinitely big.)
- Physics is the same throughout the universe.
- The development of biological and chemical things follows physical laws.
- Natural evolution can occur anywhere.
- So, some scientists think there is a very good chance life exists in space.

But where is it?

And do we want to find it?

Think about the effect of European explorers on Native Americans. Think of the effect of the development of Taiwan by people from mainland China on the aboriginals of Taiwan.

## Bingo

- Listen for your word
- Translate your word into Chinese
- Announce to the class the translation
- Get a point from Dr Bean

## Your experience of school

- One teacher you liked and your reason
- One teacher you didn't like and your reason
- One subject you liked and your reason
- One subject you didn't like and your reason


## Dr Bean's experience of school

- He liked a teacher called Mr Stelzer, who taught mathematics, because he made the subject interesting and was enthusiastic. I think he took a personal interest in me.
- He didn't like another math teacher, because the teacher wasn't enthusiastic and the mathematics he was teaching that year wasn't interesting. 'If you get a loan from the bank for $5,000 and interest is 5% per year, how much interest will you pay over 5 years?'

- He liked mathematics, because it was exciting being able to solve problems, and he did well in it.
- He didn't like English or French. The reason he didn't like English was Shakespeare and the other books we read weren't interesting. He didn't like French, because it seemed like there was no content in it. It didn't seem like he was learning anything valuable.

## Your evaluation of teachers

- What do you think of teachers?
- Would you like to be a teacher?

## Dr Bean's evaluation of teachers

- At school, Dr Bean didn't think highly of teachers. They didn't speak to you personally, but to nobody in particular. They talked down to you. In high school they called me, Matheson, but I had to call my math teacher Mr Stelzer, even though I called him Stelzer with other students.
- Dr Bean had no wish to become a teacher. But in Japan, he became very interested in learning languages, and he started teaching to make a living. He found teaching English very interesting. Even now, though, he is not proud to be a teacher.

## The death penalty

The US is the only industrially-developed country, along with Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, that still has the death penalty, according to: [Capital punishment in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States)

## Points of view on the death penalty

- Who agrees/disagrees with capital punishment?
- What point is argued by one, but NOT both, Francesca and Abena?
	- Does the existence of a death penalty reduce the number of murders that take place?
	- Is it expensive dealing with murderers?
- Abena says the death penalty shouldn't exist because it tells every member of society:
	- that he/she may be killed next
	- that it is OK to kill people to solve problems.
