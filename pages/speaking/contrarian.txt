00:00 How an intelligent person can sound really dumb.
00:04 This is the Contrary Public Speaker. Communications coaching for executives and those who want to be them.
00:10 An exclusive podcast hosted by Leandra Tedescu, June 7, 2006
00:16 In today's podcast, we'll look at the pitfalls of pronunciation. It can kill you.
00:27 In communication in the news, a ban on public speaking. And finally, we'll answer listener questions on eye contact, and looking away.

1:26 Winograd really has a beautiful voice, resonant pitch, crystal-clear diction, good rate.
1:30 You could tell from that clip that she was right on with all the aspects of her delivery.
1:35 But you probably caught her mistake as quickly as I did.
1:39 And I'm betting that you cringed, just as I did.

...

2:06 But the bigger question is, why should such a simple error have such a huge impact on my perception of her.
2:12 Everyone makes mistakes, right?
2:14 It doesn't mean she's completely stupid, right?
2:17 Well, unfortunately, it caused me, and very probably many others, to have a reflex action that said, precisely that.
2:25 It comes down to what we've been talking about for the last few weeks. Credibility.
2:31 Mispronouncing a word is a mistake that is most often made by children. Therefore we associate mispronunciations with immaturity, not credibility.
2:41 Secondly, we hhh

3:13 So, how do you avoid this. Like I mentioned before, anyone can make a mistake. 
3:19 Here's how to make sure you don't mistake pronunciation.
3:24 When you write a speech, be sure that you write from your own vocabulary base, using words that you are familiar with.
3:33 If you do introduce a new word, just make sure you look it up before you use it.
3:37 You might be saying, Well, Winograd's comments sounded off-the-cuff. They weren't scripted beforehand. So how do you avoid mispronunciation mistakes in the moment?
3:46 Well, I doubt that her comments were off-the-cuff. When people are speaking extemperaneously, they rarely use words that aren't a part of their natural language pattern.

4:00 And the perils of not practicing. It would have only taken one person to hear the mispronunciation to correct it.
4:08 If they had and if she had pronounced the word correctly, who knows, she might have won some more votes.
