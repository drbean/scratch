1:00 So how do you define your message?
Listen up.
Consider the situation. Ask yourself what is going on in the workplace. Determine what your audience needs to know about what your team is working on and why it's important. That concept should form the backbone of your presentation.
Communicate what people need to know. Give people the facts. Link your facts to benefits. Demonstrate that what your team does makes things better because it offers a new solution, improves quality, or reduces costs. 
Use stories. Make the facts come alive with stories. 
Translate what you do into benefits for stakeholders, customers, employees, or shareholders. 
Defining the message is really an act of discipline. It is synchronizing your mind with your words to deliver a coherent statement about what is important.
What you include focuses attention. What you do not include is immaterial. Give people the information they can get nowhere else or from anyone else. 
That's a good starting point, and will enable you to quickly hone in on what needs to be said and why.
