What I already said in the German version of this video, uhm, that I didn't like my English lessons because, and to my mind, they were terribly boring. And I started English, I started learning English voluntarily, when I was 17, because uhm, Latin, we had read, Asterix and Cleopatra in Latin, and I, then I thought, Hey, that is a great idea. I can also do it in English.

And then I spontaneously decided, um, to consume a lot of media in English. So I read comics, I went online, went to many American chatrooms. And then I watched Cartoon Network. And I watched lots of movies and stuff like that. 

And, many year, many years later, I started giving private tutoring in English. I explained to my pupils how they can consume the English language, um, via the Internet. Which is actually, amazingly simple. Everything you have to do is, um, go to their computer room and ask them to go online and to tell you everything about they love to watch on TV, they love to read in books or comics, magazines and what they love to talk about their friends.

And then you go to the Internet sites which refer to those hobbies and those interests.
