<p>
<b>Speaking students.</b> Listen to <a href=http://www.cio.com/podcast/baldoni-podcasts>John Baldoni</a> speak about how to cure <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/06-07-06.mp3>stage fright</a>.
<br>
Do you know all the expressions he uses? <b>butterflies</b>, <b>Go for it!</b>, <b>Break a leg!.</b> Do you know, <b>You have nothing to lose but </b>some bad thing. Do you know what the <b>podium</b> is? I think this is good advice: <b>Your challenge is to channel the nervousness you feel into energy you can put into your performance</b>. Go for it!
</p>

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
