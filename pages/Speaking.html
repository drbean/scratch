<h2>Language teacher remembers learning English</h2>

<p>
A <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPyj0Q1clc>German English teacher</a> remembers learning English via the Internet. He talks about <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix>Asterix</a> a comic book translated into many languages, one of which is Latin.
</p>

Although the video is interesting. It is not really a story. He has a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem>problem</a>. It is the boring English lessons. And he has the solution. It is teaching yourself via the media, comic books, the Internet, et cetera. But there is not enough <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense>suspense</a> in his story. He needs to put in some <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense>tension</a>. We don't feel any <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)>climax</a>.

<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>language-3</b> exercise.

<h3>Two language learner stories</h3>

<p>
<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/rachelLearningChinese.mp3>Rachel</a> in her advice to learners of Chinese tells two stories about people she met while learning Chinese. The stories are really about her rather than them. One is about being driven <a href=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bonkers>bonkers</a> by another learner, whose Chinese <a href=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kick%20ass>kicked hers ass</a>. The other is about being <a href=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/intimidated>intimidated</a> by another learner who was <a href=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fake>faking it</a>.

<h3>Language learner looks within</h3>

Kent Kedl, an American businessman in mainland China, talks about learning and speaking Chinese. He thinks he is like a <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/20081204_talking_monkey.mp3>>talking monkey</a>, or he thinks he is regarded as a talking monkey by his Chinese co-workers, because he doesn't have an attachment to Chinese culture. His co-workers say he is clever and bright, but this is not the same as regarding him as Chinese, or 'human.' He also doesn't think he is 'human.' when he speaks Chinese.
</p>

<p>
Now let's talk about you. How do you feel about speaking English? What is your experience here at NUU learning English? Do you feel like a talking monkey, speaking English? Tell everybody a story on wretch.cc.

<h2>Mr Bean as Best Man</h2>

Do you know the <b>best man</b>? He's a friend of the groom at the wedding, who holds the rings and gives them to the groom. He may make a speech after the wedding at the reception, as in this<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTeSl1lES8>wedding speech by Mr Bean</a>.
<br>

<br>
Mr Bean mentions a <a href=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stag+party>stag party</a>. In fact, although stag parties occur in real life and the bridegroom's friends might try to get the groom to do the things Mr Bean is talking about, they wouldn't talk about them at the wedding, as Mr Bean does.

<h2>Top Speaker's Advice</h2>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>John Baldoni with 2 talks about public speaking.

<p>
<b>Speaking students.</b> Listen to <a href=http://www.cio.com/podcast/baldoni-podcasts>John Baldoni</a> speak about how to cure <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/baldoni_stage_fright.mp3>stage fright</a>.
<br>
Do you know all the expressions he uses? <b>the willies</b>, <b>butterflies</b>, <b>Go for it!</b>, <b>Break a leg!.</b> Do you know, <b>You have nothing to lose but XXX</b>, where XXX is some bad or unimportant thing. Do you know what the <b>podium</b> is? I think this is good advice: <b>Your challenge is to channel the nervousness you feel into energy you can put into your performance</b>. Go for it!
</p>

<p>
Listen again to <a href=http://www.cio.com/podcast/baldoni-podcasts>John Baldoni</a> speak about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/baldoni_define_your_message.mp3>what to say</a> when you deliver a speech.
<br>
He is talking to business managers here, so what he says is right for delivering speeches at work, rather than elsewhere.
<br>
But his advice that you
<ul>
	<li>1) consider the situation, </li>
	<li>2) communicate what people need to know, </li>
	<li>3) use stories,</li> 
	<li>4) translate things into benefits</li>,
	<li>5) synchronize your mind with your message and </li>
	<li>6) focus the audience's attention only on what they cannot get anywhere else, </li>
</ul>
is great advice for speakers in any situation.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
