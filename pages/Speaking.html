<h2>Top Speaker's Advice</h2>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>John Baldoni with 2 talks about public speaking.

<p>
<b>Speaking students.</b> Listen to <a href=http://www.cio.com/podcast/baldoni-podcasts>John Baldoni</a> speak about how to cure <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/baldoni_stage_fright.mp3>stage fright</a>.
<br>
Do you know all the expressions he uses? <b>the willies</b>, <b>butterflies</b>, <b>Go for it!</b>, <b>Break a leg!.</b> Do you know, <b>You have nothing to lose but XXX</b>, where XXX is some bad or unimportant thing. Do you know what the <b>podium</b> is? I think this is good advice: <b>Your challenge is to channel the nervousness you feel into energy you can put into your performance</b>. Go for it!
</p>

<p>
Listen again to <a href=http://www.cio.com/podcast/baldoni-podcasts>John Baldoni</a> speak about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/baldoni_define_your_message.mp3>what to say</a> when you deliver a speech.
<br>
He is talking to business managers here, so what he says is right for delivering speeches at work, rather than elsewhere.
<br>
But his advice that you
<ul>
	<li>1) consider the situation, </li>
	<li>2) communicate what people need to know, </li>
	<li>3) use stories,</li> 
	<li>4) translate things into benefits</li>,
	<li>5) synchronize your mind with your message and </li>
	<li>6) focus the audience's attention only on what they cannot get anywhere else, </li>
</ul>
is great advice for speakers in any situation.

<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>message</b> exercise.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
