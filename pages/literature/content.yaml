        title: Robin Hood and his Merry Men
        blurb: |
          Robin Hood was an outlaw living in a forest. He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. He also was very good with a bow and arrow.
        comment: Although early songs were written about Robin Hood, books were not written until later. Read Howard Pyle's <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>, written at the end of the 19th century.
