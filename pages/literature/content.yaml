        title: Robin Hood and his Merry Men
        blurb: |
          Robin Hood was an outlaw living in a forest. He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. He also was very good with a bow and arrow.
        comment: Although early songs were written about Robin Hood, books were not written until later. Read Howard Pyle's <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>, written at the end of the 19th century.

          The book and movie versions that have been published since have tried to make the story more interesting by adding events and characters. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222519/episodes">made-for-TV version</a> we see here has different characters and stories. Listen to clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ8Q86OVZoc">Episodes 1-3</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDFCBG7n_Xw">Episodes 4-6</a>.
