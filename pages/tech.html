<h2><a name=call>Computer and Multimedia-Assisted Language Teaching</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
This course is about using the computer and multimedia to learn English.
<br>
Dr Bean thinks when we talk about the computer and multimedia we can talk indirectly about learning, something which is difficult to do directly.

<h3><a name=flash>Using the computer to sequence flash cards</a></h3>
<p>
Flash cards are/were small cards with a word on one side and the translation on the other. Nowadays the computer is used to space repetition of forgotten words more frequently and remembered words less frequently. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard</a>.

<h4><a name=sport>Sports/Fitness sublists: Theory, Activities, Weight training, Sports</a></h4>
<p>
We have learned 150 words in the 4 categories: Fitness theory, activities, weight training and sports for the midterm exam, using Anki or Mnemosyne. But first we need to establish what the base level is.

</p>
<p>
To do this, we will guess the meanings (in Chinese) of the words, or if we know them, just write them in.
</p>
<p>
Fill in the blanks in the <a 
href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/aca/script/aca_fastcgi.pl/login?exercise=sports-test>sports-test</a> exercise. (You will be asked to log in.)

<h2>Old Exercises</h2>
</p>

<p>
Can't find an exercise you didn't finish in a previous week? You can't do that exercise now for credit. But you may be able to find it on the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Access.html#call>Self-access</a> page.

<h2><a name="login"> Logging in </a></h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is any name you want to use. English is good, Chinese is OK too. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first (second?) Chinese name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the Hanyu Pinyin (漢語拼音) spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
</ul>
