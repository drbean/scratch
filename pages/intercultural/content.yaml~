        blurb: |
          <a href=http://www.google.com.tw/search?hl=zh-TW&q=中秋&btnG=Google+搜尋&meta=&aq=f&oq=>Moon Festival</a> is special for Taiwanese, but why is <a href=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22Moon%20Festival%22>Moon Festival</a> special for foreigners?
          <p>
          Listen to <a href=http://misadventuresintaiwan.gemismyname.com/old/about.html>Gem</a> talk about the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/date.mp3>date</a>, <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/background.mp3>background</a> and <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/barbecue.mp3>barbecuing</a> from the foreigner's viewpoint.

        comment: She talks pretty fast and she's got a lot to say. How are her ideas about Moon Festival different than your ideas.

        comment: It's difficult. Think about what you are listening to. Have you ever had this feeling? At a new school, in the first week? At a new job? At a meeting?

        blurb: |
          <a href=http://fairus.org>FAIR</a> is a special interest group that wants to stop more immigrants to America. Listen to FAIR president talk with a staffer about the group's <a href=http://www.fairus.org/video/sr_podcast_91907.mp3>telephone calls to lawmakers in Washington</a> in 2007 in an effort to persuade the US Congress not to pass the DREAM Act, a law to allow illegal immigrants to stay in the US.
          <p>
          Read about opposition to the DREAM Act on <a href=http://www.steinreport.com/archives/2007_09.html>STEIN REPORT</a>, FAIR president Dan Stein's blog. Search for <b>DREAM Act</b>.
        comment: What do you think about the fact a lot of people in the US don't want you to immigrate to the US. They don't like foreigners. They don't like you. Why do they think this way? Was FAIR justified in its opposition to the DREAM Act? What do you think about foreigners in Taiwan: Filipino, Thai, Americans, Russians, mainland Chinese?

        title: Multilingualism in Switzerland
        blurb: There are <b>four</b> official languages in Switzerland. But most people only speak <b>one</b> of those languages. The most common second language they speak is <b>English</b>!!! That's like in Taiwan, Mandarin doesn't exist, everyone speaks either Taiwanese or Hakka, and the only other language they speak is some English. Can you imagine that?
        comment: Listen to this video recording from a French-speaking Swiss woman, <a href=http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2008/03/30/interviewed-about-multilingualism-by-andrea-vascellari/>Stephanie Booth on multilingualism in Switzerland</a>.

        title: Smiling
        blurb: Last Friday, Regina Lee (李蕙丞) was talking about how black people in the US wouldn't look at her. But do <b>Taiwanese people</b> look at Americans the "right way"? In particular, are there differences between the US and Taiwan in when people smile. I remember the wife of a Taiwanese professor laughing when she saw I had hurt my back. She made me feel very bad!
        comment: Listen to this podcast from a German business English magazine, <a href=http://www.business-spotlight.de>Business Spotlight</a> about <a href=http://odeo.com/episodes/13604823-Intercultural-Non-verbal-communication-The-Business-Spotlight-podcast-for-Tuesday-26-June-2007>smiling in the US and in Germany</a>. Is Taiwan more like the US or Germany?

        title: Bissky on questions and expressing disagreement
        blurb: |
          Do you like to ask questions in front of a lot of your peers? Do you like to express your disagreement when you don't agree with someone?
          <p>
          Look at Bissky talk about how Western business people find doing business in China frustrating because of the Chinese reluctance to ask questions and express disagreement, in <a href=http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=RouM6sRpwo0>Western-Chinese Business: Different Rules of Communication</a> on Youtube.
          <p>
          This is a long listening passage. Did you get his <b>four</b> rules.
          <ul>
          	<li>His Western rule about asking questions.</li>
          	<li>His Chinese rule about <b>not</b> asking questions.</li>
          	<li>His rule about not doing anything in groups in China.</li>
          	<li>His Western rule about stating honest opinions.</li>
          </ul>
        comment:  He implies that Chinese do not state their honest opinion, and they also do not express disagreement honestly. What do you think? I don't think what he says is really correct. I think he is exaggerating.

        title: Bissky on Disagreement by raising objections
        blurb: How do you communicate disagreement? What does the other party understand you to mean, when you raise objections to their plan?
        comment: <a href=http://tw.youtube.com/user/gabissky>Greg Bissky</a> says Westerners and Chinese business people may fail to communicate because of their misunderstanding of what the other party believes objections mean, in <a href=http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=z4HB1aUE4p4>Western-Chinese Business: Saying No Without Saying No</a> on Youtube.
