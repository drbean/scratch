This feels pretty wierd, doesn't it. It's like I'm breaking some unwritten rule, right? Well, psychologists would say I'm breaking about two or three at once.

Too much staring, too little personal space. Put them together and suddenly something's got to give. You've got to break eye contact, or get away.

It's actually called the Elevator Effect. Funny thing is, it's not confined to elevators. It happens in all sorts of places. Even in a place where almost all the other unwritten rules don't apply.

You may have heard of Second Life. It's like a virtual society where you can interact with other people in the same massive online world.

Except here's there's no preset game to play or guidelines to follow. You can do anything you want. There's something you need, you build it. Build a new me.

No rules, right? Well, not quite. Stanford psychologist Nick Yi studies social behavior in Second Life. He agreed to meet me there to show me how those real-life unwritten rules are still important even in a world where no-one needs an elevator.

But there were some pretty important similarities, too.

Yi: Mmmh, you look across a scene in general, people are pretty spread-out. They try to maintain a decent amount of personal space.

Other eerie similarities showed up too. Like, how men always keep more space between each other than they do when talking to a woman.

4:50 Rosenfeld: But why do we follow these rules in a virtual world? Why should things like interpersonal distance and eye contact even matter? 

Yi: So there's probably both a hard-wired innate component to it, as well as a social component to it. And we're so used to these norms, you know, as we're growing up, that, you know, when someone violates them unexpectedly, it's incredibly, uh, psychologically uncomfortable when they do that.
