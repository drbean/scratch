title: Technical English
blurb: |+
         <p>
         Technical English means English that only experts need to know.
         English that only some people, not all people, need to know.

         <br>
         Some people think Technical English means English for Science and Technology. I think  it includes that, but it also includes English for airline pilots, English for food   and cooking, English for travel, and English for law.                                 

         <br>
         I think it is English for Specific Purposes, which is a very big part of learning      English.

        title: Nurse tells daughter about patients dying
        blurb: |
         Dana Viviano is a nurse who works with cancer patients who are dying. Her daugher, Sarafino was interested in hearing <a href=http://www.storycorps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/listen/audio/viviano.mp3>how she feels about the job</a>. Read the <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111633198>NPR report</a>.
        comment: I think being a doctor or a nurse must be a terrible job. Even worse than being a nurse is being a patient. What is a way to look at this story and feel good? Why is this a good story?

        comment: Losing your memory doesn't seem to be a very bad physical condition, but the consequences for the family of the patient can be worse than other forms of sickness. In the US and Europe, the families of people with Alzheimer's disease find caring for them very difficult. How is it in Taiwan?

    title: Cultural events
    intro: What are some events where people get together and celebrate something? Christmas is one. In the West, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Christmas</a> is a family event, especially significant for children because it's the one occasion in the year, besides birthdays, when they get new toys. Some families intentionally mislead children, having them believe Santa Claus really exists. Putting presents under a decorated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree">Christmas tree</a> and opening them on Christmas morning is an important part of Christmas.

Most severe loss of life occurred in New Orleans, where the levee system failed, and 80 percent of the city was flooded. However worst property damage occurred in Mississippi gulf towns where flood waters reached 10-20 kilometers from the beach.

        comment: In the United States, the casket with the dead body is often left open and people go up to pay their last respects. Because the body is often not pleasant to look at after death, a mortician will often put makeup on the face to make the face easier to look at. In England and Australia, the casket (or coffin) is kept closed. What do you think about these practices?

        comment: The vocabulary is simple but what they are saying is not. They also speak quite quickly and they are not trying to pronounce what they say clearly. They know each other well. They worked together for nearly 10 years. The story reminds me of that of the doorman at the Plaza, Ed Trinka, but Ed was speaking a lot more clearly. He was talking to a woman, who he did not know so well.

          With the liberalization of laws in other states, Nevada is now no longer the "divorce capital" of the United States. <br>
          Some interesting expressions.
          <ul>
           <li>A prize package (Usually "no prize package"): a collection of wonderful things you get when you win a prize.
           <li>To walk down the aisle: To get married.
           <li>An awful lot: Many.
           <li>The next thing I knew: Quickly. Used to introduce a surprising event, but one which bring stability and the end to a period of complete confusion.
          </ul>

The children of these 'disrupted' adoptions may spend years in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care">foster care</a>, an experience which can make them very unhappy children.
