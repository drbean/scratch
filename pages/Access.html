<h2><a name=storycorps>Storycorps--American stories</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<a href=http://www.storycorps.org>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
<br>
A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

<div class=topic id="ceremonies">
<h3><a name=ceremonies>Cultural events</a></h3>
<p>
What are some events where people get together and celebrate something? Christmas is one. In the West, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Christmas</a> is a family event, especially significant for children because it's the one occasion in the year, besides birthdays, when they get new toys. Some families intentionally mislead children, having them believe Santa Claus really exists. Putting presents under a decorated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree">Christmas tree</a> and opening them on Christmas morning is an important part of Christmas.

<p>
Listen to Mary Breakstone describe <a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/stories/mary-and-bob-breakstone">Christmas as the child sees it</a>. Christmas corresponds to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year">Chinese New Year</a>, I think.

<h2>Old Exercises</h2>
</p>

<p>
Can't find an exercise you didn't finish in a previous week? You can't do that exercise now for credit. But you may be able to find it on the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Access.html#storycorps>Self-access</a> page.

<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
</ul>
