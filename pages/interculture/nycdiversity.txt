BBC: Let's return now to Leonard Lopate at WNYC.

Lopate: And you know, Madelika, the ... just our daily experience, uh, is a revelation when you think about diversity. My haircutter is from Morocco. My building superintendent is from Albania. My cab driver last night was from the Cote d'Ivoire. 

And, uh, we have uh, a call to Shan Con. Shan, uh, what's it like being a hyphenated American in New York?

Shan, are you there?

Shan: Hi, yeh. Uh, actually I'm half Pakistani, half Irish. which is a combination I think you can only find in New York City.

Lopate: And what is your experience in New York? Why would you call New York the most diverse city in the world?

Shan: Well, you know, just where I am, where I live in Brooklyn, on my block, we have a Ukrainian-run laundromat, a Korean-run Tex-Mex restaurant, and a pizzeria owned and operated by a Latino family.

I mean, if I need a dose of diversity, all I need to do is open my bedroom window, and the smell just wafts right in.
