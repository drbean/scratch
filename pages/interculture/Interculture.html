<h1>Multilingualism and Multiculturalism</h1>

<p>
<h2>Multilingualism in Switzerland</h2>
There are <b>four</b> official languages in Switzerland. But most people only speak <b>one</b> of those languages. The most common second language they speak is <b>English</b>!!! That's like in Taiwan, Mandarin doesn't exist, everyone speaks either Taiwanese or Hakka, and the only other language they speak is some English. Can you imagine that?
</p>
<p>
Listen to this video recording from a French-speaking Swiss woman, <a href=http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2008/03/30/interviewed-about-multilingualism-by-andrea-vascellari/>Stephanie Booth on multilingualism in Switzerland</a>.

<h2>Bilingual education in San Francisco's Chinatown</h2>
Nichols vs Lau, a very famous law case in 1974 introduced bilingual education to the US. Now however, California schools are not allowed to teach students in their first languages for more than one year. Why? What do you think about these changes in bilingual education?

<h2>Communication</h2>
<br>
<p>
<h3>Non-verbal communication</h3>

<p>
<h2>Smiling</h2>
 Do Taiwanese people smile during service encounters? Are there differences between the West and Taiwan in when people smile. I remember the wife of a Taiwanese professor smiling when she found out I had hurt my back. She made me feel even worse than I already felt!
</p>
<p>
Listen to this podcast from a German business English magazine, <a href=http://www.business-spotlight.de>Business Spotlight</a> about <a href=http://odeo.com/episodes/13604823-Intercultural-Non-verbal-communication-The-Business-Spotlight-podcast-for-Tuesday-26-June-2007>smiling in the US and in Germany</a>

<h2>Greg Bissky's videos on communication styles</h2>

<p>
<a href=http://tw.youtube.com/user/gabissky>Greg Bissky</a> a Canadian business consultant operating in mainland China (and Taiwan) has some interesting videos about Chinese-Western communication problems,
</p>

<p>
See his website: <a href=http://www.treasuremountain.com/>http://www.treasuremountain.com/</a>
<p>

<h3>Bissky on questions and expressing disagreement</h3>
Do you like to ask questions in front of a lot of your peers? Do you like to express your disagreement when you don't agree with someone?
</p>

<p>
Look at Bissky talk about how Western business people find doing business in China frustrating because of the Chinese reluctance to ask questions and express disagreement, in <a href=http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=RouM6sRpwo0>Western-Chinese Business: Different Rules of Communication</a> on Youtube.

</p>

This is a long listening passage. Did you get his <b>four</b> rules.
<ul>
	<li>His Western rule about asking questions.</li>
	<li>His Chinese rule about <b>not</b> asking questions.</li>
	<li>His rule about not doing anything in groups in China.</li>
	<li>His Western rule about stating honest opinions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> He implies that Chinese do not state their honest opinion, and they also do not express disagreement honestly. What do you think? I don't think what he says is really correct.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Bissky on Disagreement by raising objections</h3>
How do you communicate disagreement? What does the other party understand you to mean, when you raise objections to their plan?
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://tw.youtube.com/user/gabissky>Greg Bissky</a> says Westerners and Chinese business people may fail to communicate because of their misunderstanding of what the other party believes objections mean, in <a href=http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=z4HB1aUE4p4>Western-Chinese Business: Saying No Without Saying No</a> on Youtube.

<h2>Moon Festival</h2>

</p>

<p>
<a href=http://www.google.com.tw/search?hl=zh-TW&q=中秋&btnG=Google+搜尋&meta=&aq=f&oq=>Moon Festival</a> is special for Taiwanese, but why is <a href=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22Moon%20Festival%22>Moon Festival</a> special for foreigners?

</p>

<p>
Listen to <a href=http://misadventuresintaiwan.gemismyname.com/old/about.html>Gem</a> talk about the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/date.mp3>date</a>, <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/background.mp3>background</a> and <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/barbecue.mp3>barbecuing</a> from the foreigner's viewpoint. This track is extracted from one of her <a href=http://misadventuresintaiwan.wordpress.com>Misadventures in Taiwan Podcasts</a>

</p>

<p>
She talks pretty fast and she's got a lot to say. This week, listen to her talk about barbecuing and <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>transcribe</a> what she says.

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. The first letter of the password is a capital letter. The spelling of the U in 育 is a big U, not a small u.  See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
