	"William Kendall's parents had a successful farm, so he was learning about the business of food from childhood. He later became a lawyer and a banker and this helped him learn about business practices.

His wife had also inherited a farm, but she and her family knew nothing about farming. Helping her family running the farm, he learned how to cook. He enjoyed making soup. He thought selling fresh soup would be a good idea. He thought fresh soup would be popular, and he could make a lot of money, because it tastes better than soup in a can.

A company which also had the idea of selling fresh soup contacted him and he started working there. After some years he became the chief executive of the company, called the New Covent Garden Soup Company. He stayed there for nine years. And sales went from two million pounds to more than twenty million pounds.

When he saw that the New Covent Garden Soup Company had become successful and there was little for him to do, he decided he wanted to do something else. But it was difficult for him to find someone to buy the business from him. People realized that the company was successful because he was in control. They thought that if someone else took over the company, it wouldn't be as successful as it had been before.

It took him two years to get a shareholder of the New Covent Garden Soup Company to buy the company. The shareholder was only willing to take over the New Covent Garden Soup Company if William Kendall joined this other company.
