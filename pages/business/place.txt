Place

Place is where Uniqlo products may be bought and also the ways the clothes are delivered or distributed to these places.

Uniqlo controls very carefully the places where its clothes may be bought. It has its own stores, and it has places in department stores, where the customer feels they are in a special Uniqlo store.

It wants to create an environment where the customer has a unique Uniqlo experience. If people can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere, they don't have that special Uniqlo experience.

And people will think the Uniqlo brand is less fashionable if they can buy Uniqlo clothes anywhere.
