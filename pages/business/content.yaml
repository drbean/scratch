title: Business English--Listening
blurb: |
         <p>
         <b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
         <br>
         The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
         <br>
         We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

          All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.

    intro: With the Internet, people are transferring their attention from people to computers. People are interacting, not with other people, but computers and the records left by other people on them. Shopping is no different. Instead of buying something from someone, we are buying it from a machine. Hopefully, the thing we have bought is still the same kind of thing it was before the Internet.

          Listen to the first half of the soundfile. But you only need to transcribe your sections. Think about the roles of control, uncertainty, support and pressure in reducing stress.

    title: Marketing
    intro: Whether a customer will buy a company's product or not is the one area of all the areas which concern it about which the company has least knowledge. At the same time, it is also the area on which its success most depends. This is why marketing was developed. An important concept in marketing is the marketing mix or the 4 P's: Product, price, place and promotion.

He thinks there are 3 things the successful marketer must have, a feeling for what consumers are thinking, an understanding of how the company makes money from its consumers, and an ability to excite everyone in the company about the company's marketing strategy.
        comment: Being a marketer is very stressful, because of pressure from other divisions in the company which are opposed to the marketer, because of inability to control consumers and because of uncertainty about marketing campaign results. The marketing division needs lots of support from the CEO of the company.
