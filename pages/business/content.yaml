title: Business English--Listening
blurb: |
         <p>
         <b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
         <br>
         The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
         <br>
         We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

          All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.
          </p>

          <ul>
          <li><b>A students:</b> Listen to AWB talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerA.mp3>planning, networking and family.</a> </li>
          <li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL say you need to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerB.mp3>think about the job and try to make it better.</a> </li>
          <li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerC.mp3>teamwork, doing things the hard way and being organized.</a> </li>
          <li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED suggest you need to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerD.mp3>keep learning, make sure the boss understands how you think, and think about what you are doing.</a> </li>

          Only one track this week, the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careercandidate.mp>connection between thinking about your career and being a job candidate</a>. Think about the career tips on page 8. What would the candidates on page 13 choose as most important.
