title: Business English--Listening
blurb: |
         <p>
         <b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
         <br>
         The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
         <br>
         We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

          All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.

    intro: With the Internet, people are transferring their attention from people to computers. People are interacting, not with other people, but computers and the records left by other people on them. Shopping is no different. Instead of buying something from someone, we are buying it from a machine. Hopefully, the thing we have bought is still the same kind of thing it was before the Internet.

          <p>The problems are the website, the different needs of different customers, integrating online and store operation, and increased competition online and what marketers have done about it. Listen to each of the soundfiles describing the problems.

For the people who win a lot of money from him, he has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn_Las_Vegas#Penske-Wynn_Ferrari-Maserati_dealership">car showroom</a> that sells expensive cars. There he can get back some of the money that he has lost to them. But people were just coming to look at the cars. That is the problem. What was the good idea? Did it work?

        blurb: Punjab farmers and the government were able to develop the Punjab, a farming area in India, by growing citrus. The government takes farmers' land for 4 years and gives farmers 50 percent from sale of the fruit. What do you think? What is the problem that this good idea solves? Did it work?

    intro: Whether a customer will buy a company's product or not is the one area of all the areas which concern it about which the company has least knowledge. At the same time, it is also the area on which its success most depends. This is why marketing was developed. An important concept in marketing is the marketing mix or the 4 P's: Product, price, place and promotion.

        comment: Being a marketer is very stressful, because of pressure from other divisions in the company which are opposed to the marketer, because of inability to control consumers and because of uncertainty about marketing campaign results. The marketing division needs lots of support from the CEO of the company.

Most companies prevent people making changes, rather than encourage them to make changes. That's not good. He also believes, 'I can do it.' He says some people don't think this.
        comment: Kendall talks about New Covent Garden and Green & Black's.  He describes how the companies were different. New Covent Garden Soup Company was based on a constant development of new products and involvement of everyone in the company in creating new soup ideas. Green and Black's was based on the idea that you could make dark chocolate a luxurious, but popular, product. A problem at Green and Black's is that after he sold the company to Cadbury's, people at the company feel they didn't own it any more, and they are not as energetic.

        title: Organic food and William Kendall
        blurb: William Kendall didn't originally believe in organic food. How did he become a believer? Organic food is supposed to be food that is good for you. But chocolate isn't really good for you, is it? How could someone who believes in healthy food make so much money from food which isn't good for you?

        title: A framework for discussing conflict
        blurb: Robert Mnookin's framework has 3 dimensions. The first dimension (dividing the pie and creating a bigger pie) is about whether the 2 parties can think not just about getting what each wants, but also about how helping the other party may allow them to BOTH get what they want and MORE than they can expect. The second dimension (empathy and assertiveness) is about the poor communication in conflict. Each party lacks the ability to understand what the other party wants and the ability to express what IT wants. The third dimension is about the personal ownership of the reasons for the conflict. The issue about which there is conflict may not belong to the people who are in conflict. Each party may be just a representative of other people who are not there.

          <li> This framework in the <a href="http://www.mediate.com//articles/mnookin_full.cfm">first video</a>, starting at 24:23, is on the exam in Week 18.
          <li> In the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMC-FxqPDWU">second video</a>, starting at 34:00, Mnookin describes the difference between intuitive thinking and analytical thinking. He says people should analyze their intuitions, not to support those intuitions, but to judge whether the intuitions are correct.
