title: Business English--Listening
blurb: |
         <p>
         <b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
         <br>
         The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
         <br>
         We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

          All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.

People are interacting, not with other people, but computers and the records left by other people on them. Shopping is no different.

        title: Organic food and William Kendall
        blurb: William Kendall didn't originally believe in organic food. How did he become a believer? Organic food is supposed to be food that is good for you. But chocolate isn't really good for you, is it? How could someone who believes in healthy food make so much money from food which isn't good for you?

        blurb: The most important thing a manager can do is motivate people by understanding how they are different AND how they are the same as other people, and by thinking about their goals. Managers also need to understand how people from another culture are the same AND different than people from their own culture.

        title: A different story about Olivier, Todd, Jacques, and Charles
        blurb: I wrote a different story about European Campers. Olivier is not the cause of the conflict. Some other person, Todd, Jacques, or Charles is the problem. In fact I wrote two different stories and mixed them up. Can you sort out the two different stories?
        comment: A and B and C and D each have half of one of the stories. In one half there is information about Charles and Jacques. In the other half there is information about Olivier and Todd. Which half goes with which half? Who is the problem in each of the two different stories?

        blurb: In this story about European Campers. Todd is the cause of conflict. Next week, in the exam, you will have to find out who is the cause of conflict. It will be either this story, or the 2 stories we did last week, where Jacques, and Charles was the problem. Last week I wrote two different stories and mixed them up. This week there is only one story, the jigsaw story we did in class. In the exam next week, there will be one of these 3 stories about Charles, Jacques or Todd.
        comment: Find your sound file from the following files. Are you Olivier, Charles, Todd or Jacques. Are you the cause of the confict? Who is the cause of the conflict?

Huang speaks standard American English and is a lot easier to understand than the Indian CEO, of Cooliris. So, this week the dictation is more difficult. For each word in the dictation, only the last letter is given. Again, either answer the question or fill in the letters.
