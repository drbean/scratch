title: Business English--Listening
blurb: |
         <p>
         <b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
         <br>
         The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
         <br>
         We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

          All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.

    intro: With the Internet, people are transferring their attention from people to computers. People are interacting, not with other people, but computers and the records left by other people on them. Shopping is no different. Instead of buying something from someone, we are buying it from a machine. Hopefully, the thing we have bought is still the same kind of thing it was before the Internet.
