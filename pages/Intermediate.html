<h2><a name=storycorps>Storycorps--American stories</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<a href=http://www.storycorps.net>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
<br>
A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

<p>
Listen to the rest of <a href=http://www.storycorps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/listen/audio/kroenke.mp3>Ron Kroenke's story</a>. Some people were angry. Others were disappointed, but more sympathetic.

<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
