<h2>Storycorps</h2>
<br>
<a href=http://www.storycorps.net>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
<br>
A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting and likeable.

<h2>Old stories</h2>

<h4>Bio-dad</h4>

<p>
A story about meeting a biological father for the first time. <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11532743>NIck Shepard</a>'s mother and father split up. We don't learn the details from Nick or his father. Perhaps he was brought up by his mother alone. Perhaps not. Read the <a href=http://www.storycorps.org/listen/stories/nick-shepard-hugh-ryan>NPR write-up</a>.
</p>

<p>
How is this story different than the <a href=#biomom>biomom</a> one.
</p>

<h4>Bio-mom</h4>

<p>
Before we listened to a story with a biological father. <a name=biomom>Here</a> is one with a <a href=http://www.wordspy.com/words/bio-mom.asp>bio-mom</a>. <a href=http://www.storycorps.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/listen/audio/adam.mp3>Listen</a> to Sue Adam and Deborah Dimasi talk about their relationship.

<br>
</p>

<h4>Crocs and gators</h4>

<p>
Look at the video of Steve Irwin <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVEVUxyxBJc>crying over Mary, a dead crocodile</a>. Were they <a href=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=crocodile+tears>crocodile tears</a>.

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
