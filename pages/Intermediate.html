<h2>Storycorps</h2>
<br>
<a href=http://www.storycorps.net>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
<br>
A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting and likeable. 

<p>
<b>Intermediate students.</b> Listen to <a href=http://www.storycorps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/listen/audio/jackson.mp3>the rest</a> of <a href=http://www.storycorps.net/listen/charles-jackson>Charles Jackson</a>'s story about his mother's and his <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease>Alzheimer's disease</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>jackson-2</b> exercises.
</p>

<p>
Is there still an error message when you answer the question? Does it tell you if you got the right answer or not?

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
