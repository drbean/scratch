<h2><a name=business>Business English--Listening</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
<br>
The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
<br>
We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

<div class=topic id="careers">
<h3><a name=careers>Getting on top of work</a></h3>
<p>
Work is something that is hard to avoid, but which can destroy you. How do you take control of work, and not let work take control of you?
</p>
<div class=story id="career">
<h4><a name=career>Week 1: How to get ahead at work</a></h4>
<p>
Look at the 10 ways of thinking about your career in Reading B on page 8 of Market Leader. These are all important things to do if you want to make something of your life. Which are the most important ideas?

</p>
<p>
<p>
All 4 people, AWB, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of what's important when thinking about your career. But they each chose 3 of the 10 ways in the book. Which ways did they choose? Two people each chose one idea which was the same.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to AWB talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerA.mp3>planning, networking and family.</a> </li>
<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL say you need to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerB.mp3>think about the job and try to make it better.</a> </li>
<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerC.mp3>teamwork, doing things the hard way and being organized.</a> </li>
<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED suggest you need to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careerD.mp3>keep learning, make sure the boss understands how you think, and think about what you are doing.</a> </li>
</ul>

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
