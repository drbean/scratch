<h2>Managing people</h2>

<h3>Nigel Nicholson's advice to Muller-Peterson and Oliver, Todd and Charles</h3>

<p>
By the exam Week 18, listen to what Nigel Nicholson would say about the problems of the sales teams at the two different companies on <b>page 85, 86</b> and <b>page 96, 97</b>

<ul>
<li>He thinks listening and asking good questions to understand motivation is very important.
<li>He thinks standing back and looking at the big picture, or trying to understand how what you are doing is part of a system, is very important.
<li>He thinks understanding how everyone thinks differently, but thinks they think the same is important.
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to Nicholson's advice that managers try to find <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/analysisA.mp3>points of agreement</a>.</li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to his advice that assistant managers and Todd <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/analysisB.mp3>understand their own motivation</a>.</li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to his advice to Oliver and the Muller sales team that they <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/analysisC.mp3>cooperate and have respect for the system</a>.</li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to his analysis of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/analysisD.mp3>system point of view</a> of the Peterson sales team.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then,
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/correct/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>advice</b> exercise.</b>
</p>

<p>
<h1>Old Topics</h1>
</p>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week and the next few weeks, we are thinking about how managers do their jobs. How do they do the company's work, by getting other people to do that work?

<h3>Conflict on the job</h3>

<p>
On page 96-97 of the textbook there is a story about conflict at a camping equipment company. Oliver, a very successful sales rep, is hard for Todd, the sales manager, to handle. Charles <b>(A)</b>, the chief executive of the company will get together with Jacques <b>(B)</b>, the production manager, and Oliver <b>(C)</b>, the salesman and they will discuss with Todd <b>(D)</b> what to do.  Read the story. Look at the dialog on page 155. Listen to <b>Track 19</b> (??) of the student CD.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/conflictcharles.mp3>Charles' position</a>.</li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to what Oliver thinks about Jacques on the first half of Track 19</a>.</li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to Oliver tell Todd he is resigning on the second half of Track 19</a>.</li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/conflicttodd.mp3>Todd's position</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nigel Nicholson on management</h3>

<p>
Nigel Nicholson is a well-known professor in the UK. On this <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2959284.stm>BBC site</a>, he gives advice to people with management problems. He is interested in family businesses. What question would you ask him?
</p>

<p>
I have rewritten what he said on <b>pages 153, 154</b> and his advice to a woman who wrote that <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4481899.stm>her ideas were being stolen</a>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to BDL read his description of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/nicholsonknowledge.mp3>knowledge</a> a sales manageer should have.</li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT read his advice about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/nicholsonchange.mp3>taking time out to reflect</a>.</li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to KED read his analysis of the problems of <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/nicholsoninterculture.mp3>multi-cultural teams</a>.</li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan read his advice about the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/nicholsonstealingideas.mp3>boss stealing ideas</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then,
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/correct/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>nicholson</b> exercise.</b>
</p>

<h3>Muller and Peterson sales representatives (reps)</h3>
<p>
Sometimes managers use meetings, like on page 84,85 of the textbook. For the discussion in Week 18, we are going to have a meeting of sales representatives, like in the textbook.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to Alan describe the role and responsibilities of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/salesmanager.mp3>sales manager</a>.</li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL discuss the role and duties of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/deputy.mp3>deputy sales manager</a>.</li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about the ideas of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/muller.mp3>Muller sales representatives.</a></li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED describe the ideas of the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/peterson.mp3>Peterson sales reps</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Planning</h2>

<h3>William Kendall</h3>

<p>
	I thought the story of William Kendall and <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/gringogidget/82660682/>Green and Black Chocolates</a> was very interesting. Forty years ago, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobiotics>macrobiotics</a> or <a href=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%83%93%E3%82%AA%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF>マクロビオティック</a>, ie 長壽健康飲食法, was very radical. Now William Kendall has taken Craig Sams' idea of macrobiotic chocolates. and the two have become millionaires.
</p>

<p>
This week, I have made texts from information on the Internet about Kendall and his success with the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/hwayoungjung/2830110261/>New Covent Garden Soup Company</a> and Green and Black Chocolates, and his ideas about involving everyone in a business's plan.
</p>

<p>
The sections are long. I don't want you to fill in every word. I have noted the sections which aren't so important and which you don't have to do. I will ask you to discuss the information in the important sections in <b>Exam3</b> next week. You have until Friday night in Week 13, next week to finish the listening exercise.
</p>

<p>
Here are the articles I used:

</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to KED describe William Kendall's background and what happened at <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/coventgarden.mp3>the Covent Garden Soup Company.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to Alan discuss Kendall and <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/organic.mp3>organic food.</a> </li>

	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to SLT describe William Kendall's ideas about giving managers <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/autonomy.mp3>lots of freedom.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
What do you think of 長壽健康飲食法, and chocolate? What do you think of William Kendall's career? How would you run a business? What do you think about giving managers freedom? How would you plan to sell your business before starting? What do you think of the surprising success of William Kendall's businesses?

<h3>Teresa Graham on planning</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, with <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a>. I have rewritten what <a href=http://www.salixfinance.co.uk/biotgraham.html>Teresa Graham</a> says about planning on <b>page 72</b> of the textbook, so look at that and look at the audio script on <b>page 152</b>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to SLT describe what to keep in mind when<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/creatingplans.mp3>creating a plan.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to KED's advice on <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/workingplans.mp3>working with plans.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to Alan talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/owningplans.mp3>ownership of plans.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to BDL describe <a href=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/channels/entrepreneurs/business-leaders/22306/william-kendall-breaking-the-mould.thtml>William Kendall</a> as an <a href= <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/kendallplanning.mp3>example of good planning.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
What do you think? Should you talk to people first, or plan first? What is the role of the written plan? Can it be kept up-to-date with the real plan? What about being a member of an organization and being excited about its goals? What do you think of the story of William Kendall?
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>plans</b> exercise.
</p>

<h2>Putting on a Conference</h2>

<h3>Choosing a hotel</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, we are going back to <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a>. I expanded the descriptions of the hotels on <b>page 57</b> of the textbook, so look at that when listening to the soundfiles.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to BDL describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/morocco.mp3>Long Beach Hotel in Morocco.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/prague.mp3>the Prague hotel is a good choice.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to KED talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/island.mp3>an island hotel as the conference venue.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan suggest <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/lasvegas.mp3>a Las Vegas venue.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Which hotel should the conference be held at? Last week, we heard that having a number of seminar rooms was important. We also heard that being close to an airport was important. Which of these hotels have seminar rooms and are close to an airport?
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>hotels</b> exercise.
</p>

<h3>Planning the conference</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, I want you to listen to the soundfile, <b>Track 15.wav</b> on the CD in the back of the student's book, about what you have to think about when planning a conference.

<p>
Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to fill in the blanks in different parts of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>conference</b> exercise.
</p>

<h2>Reducing stress</h2>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a different soundfile, produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, about ideas in the company about reducing stress, by improving health and fitness.
</p>

<p>
Look at page 47 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about a human resources manager discussing health and fitness with two colleagues. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b> of track 5.4 and 5.5. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, Alan, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of the way the company can increase well-being and reduce stress. Think about the situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to Alan describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/medical.mp3>medical measures.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/food.mp3>the food is not natural.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/sports.mp3>membership in the local sports center.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED suggest <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/tours.mp3>company tours.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>stress-2</b> exercise. The exercise should correspond to the part you listened to above.
</p>

Be careful. Only the above link will work. The old link <b><h3>WILL NOT WORK</h3></b>.

<h2>Sources of stress</h2>

<p>
Look at page 48-49 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about stress felt by workers. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b>. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, CLB, SLT, RMS and Alan are feeling lots of stress. Think about their situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to CLB describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/fear.mp3>her fears of losing her job.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/freedom.mp3>management are control freaks, or micro-managers.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to RMS talk about his dissatisfaction with the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/environs.mp3>physical environment.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan complain about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/manager.mp3>his boss.</a> </li>
</ul>

<br>
Can you understand how what you hear is similar/different? Which problems are most serious? What should management do?
</p>
<p>
<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
