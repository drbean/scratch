<h2><a name=business>Business English--Listening</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Each week, each member in a group has a different sound track to listen to. Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a <b>different</b> soundfile, After listening to your sound track, tell your partners about it. How is the information on your track different/similar to the information on their tracks? Discuss what <b>you</b> think of the situation that <b>all</b> the tracks are about.
<br>
The sound files were not recorded by real people. They were produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, from texts Dr Bean wrote based on each chapter of <a href=http://www.market-leader-net>Market Leader</a>, the textbook.
<br>
We will work on one chapter over two weeks. So that means we will be doing two sets of homework based on each chapter.

<div class=topic id="careers">
<h3><a name=careers>Getting on top of work</a></h3>
<p>
Work is something that is hard to avoid, but which can destroy you. How do you take control of work, and not let work take control of you?
</p>

<div class=story id="careercandidate">
<h4><a name=careercandidate>Thinking about your career--Would you be a good candidate?</a></h4>
<p>
This week we are doing exams about your career and being a job candidate. Why will the person who has thought about his/her career be the best candidate?

</p>
<p>
Only one track this week, the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/careercandidate.mp3>connection between thinking about your career and being a job candidate</a>. Think about the career tips on page 8. What would the candidates on page 13 choose as most important?

<h2>Old Exercises</h2>
</p>

<p>
Can't find an exercise you didn't finish in a previous week? You can't do that exercise now for credit. But you may be able to find it on the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Access.html>Self-access</a> page.

<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
</ul>
