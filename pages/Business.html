<h2>Uniqlo Marketing Mix</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=http://www.uniqlo.com>Uniqlo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a different soundfile, again produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system.

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/product.mp3>a discussion of Uniqlo's product strategy.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to a <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/price.mp3>a discussion of Uniqlo's thinking about price.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/place.mp3>how Uniqlo controls where its products can be bought.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/promotion.mp3>what Uniqlo does to promote its brand.</a> </li>
</ul>

<br>
Can you understand how your part contributes to the marketing mix? How does your part relate to the other parts: product, price, place and promotion?
</p>
<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>uniqloparts</b> exercise.

<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
