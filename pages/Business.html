<h2>Putting on a Conference</h2>

<h3>Choosing a hotel</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, with <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a>. I have rewritten what <a href=http://www.salixfinance.co.uk/biotgraham.html>Teresa Graham</a> says about planning on <b>page 72</b> of the textbook, so look at that and look at the audio script on <b>page 152</b>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to SLT describe what to keep in mind when<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/creatingplans.mp3>creating a plan.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to KED's advice on <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/workingplans.mp3>working with plans.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to Alan talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/owningplans.mp3>ownership of plans.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to BDL describe <a href=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/channels/entrepreneurs/business-leaders/22306/william-kendall-breaking-the-mould.thtml>William Kendall</a> as an <a href= <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/kendallplanning.mp3>example of good planning.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
What do you think? Should you talk to people first, or plan first? What is the role of the written plan? Can it be kept up-to-date with the real plan? What about being a member of an organization and being excited about its goals? What do you think of the story of William Kendall?
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>plans</b> exercise.

<h2>Putting on a Conference</h2>

<h3>Choosing a hotel</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, we are going back to <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a>. I expanded the descriptions of the hotels on <b>page 57</b> of the textbook, so look at that when listening to the soundfiles.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to BDL describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/morocco.mp3>Long Beach Hotel in Morocco.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/prague.mp3>the Prague hotel is a good choice.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to KED talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/island.mp3>an island hotel as the conference venue.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan suggest <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/lasvegas.mp3>a Las Vegas venue.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Which hotel should the conference be held at? Last week, we heard that having a number of seminar rooms was important. We also heard that being close to an airport was important. Which of these hotels have seminar rooms and are close to an airport?
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>hotels</b> exercise.
</p>

<h3>Planning the conference</h3>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> This week, I want you to listen to the soundfile, <b>Track 15.wav</b> on the CD in the back of the student's book, about what you have to think about when planning a conference.

<p>
Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to fill in the blanks in different parts of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>conference</b> exercise.
</p>

<h2>Reducing stress</h2>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a different soundfile, produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, about ideas in the company about reducing stress, by improving health and fitness.
</p>

<p>
Look at page 47 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about a human resources manager discussing health and fitness with two colleagues. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b> of track 5.4 and 5.5. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, Alan, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of the way the company can increase well-being and reduce stress. Think about the situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to Alan describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/medical.mp3>medical measures.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/food.mp3>the food is not natural.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/sports.mp3>membership in the local sports center.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED suggest <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/tours.mp3>company tours.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>stress-2</b> exercise. The exercise should correspond to the part you listened to above.
</p>

Be careful. Only the above link will work. The old link <b><h3>WILL NOT WORK</h3></b>.

<h2>Sources of stress</h2>

<p>
Look at page 48-49 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about stress felt by workers. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b>. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, CLB, SLT, RMS and Alan are feeling lots of stress. Think about their situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to CLB describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/fear.mp3>her fears of losing her job.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/freedom.mp3>management are control freaks, or micro-managers.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to RMS talk about his dissatisfaction with the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/environs.mp3>physical environment.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan complain about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/manager.mp3>his boss.</a> </li>
</ul>

<br>
Can you understand how what you hear is similar/different? Which problems are most serious? What should management do?
</p>

<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
</ul>
