Business Dictations
</h1>

<p>
<b>Business English students.</b> Depending on whether you are <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>D</b>, I want you to listen to a different soundfile, produced by the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>Festival</a> text-to-speech system, about ideas in the company about reducing stress, by improving health and fitness.
</p>

<p>
Look at page 47 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about a human resources manager discussing health and fitness with two colleagues. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b> of track 5.4 and 5.5. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, Alan, BDL, SLT, and KED have different ideas of the way the company can increase well-being and reduce stress. Think about the situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to Alan describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/medical.mp3>medical measures.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to BDL say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/food.mp3>the food is not natural.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to SLT talk about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/sports.mp3>membership in the local sports center.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to KED suggest <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/tours.mp3>company tours.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/target/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>stress-2</b> exercise. The exercise should correspond to the part you listened to above.
</p>

Be careful. Only the above link will work. The old link <b><h3>WILL NOT WORK</h3></b>.

Look at page 48-49 of the textbook, <b>Market Leader</b> about stress felt by workers. Look at p 149 for the <b>audio script</b>. What you hear will be based on the audio script. But it will not be the same.
</p>

<p>
All 4 people, CLB, SLT, RMS and Alan are feeling lots of stress. Think about their situation. What do you think?
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A students:</b> Listen to CLB describe <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/fear.mp3>her fears of losing her job.</a> </li>
	<li><b>B students:</b> Listen to SLT say<a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/freedom.mp3>management are control freaks, or micro-managers.</a> </li>
	<li><b>C students:</b> Listen to RMS talk about his dissatisfaction with the <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/environs.mp3>physical environment.</a> </li>
	<li><b>D students:</b> Listen to Alan complain about <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/manager.mp3>his boss.</a> </li>
</ul>

<br>
Can you understand how what you hear is similar/different? Which problems are most serious? What should management do?

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
