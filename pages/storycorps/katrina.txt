   Heard on Morning Edition

   August 25, 2006 - RENEE MONTAGNE, host:

   Time now for StoryCorps. This oral history project is recording the
   stories of everyday Americans across the nation. The past year,
   StoryCorps stopped along the Gulf Coast. Today we bring you two stories
   from those visits. Each is about loss, survival and Hurricane Katrina,
   which, one year later, still haunts those who lived through it.

   Mr. DOUGLAS PAUL DESILVEY (Hurricane Katrina Survivor): My name is
   Douglas Paul deSilvey. I'm a native of the Gulf Coast. The story I want
   to tell today is about my family.

   MONTAGNE: Douglas P. deSilvey tells us this first story from Gulfport,
   Mississippi about his wife their daughter and his mother-in-law,
   Nadine.

   Mr. DESILVEY: The three women in my family have steered my life for the
   past 59 years to the man that I am today, and I hope and think that I
   am a pretty good fellow.

   Every time we had a hurricane we would all go over to Nadine's home. We
   considered this just another storm. Since '77 when she built this
   house, we been through every storm in it.

   Not knowing what we were in for, we were sitting on the bed and I could
   hear glass breaking. And I walked to the back of her bedroom, which was
   facing the Bay just to measure the water to see how high up it was. And
   in the back, the water just came up so fast it was unbelievable.

   As I turned and told them to hold hands, that we was going to have to
   get into the water, the roof came down on all of us and my lungs
   started filling up with water. And I just kept asking Jesus not to let
   me go like this. I had to get my family out.

   I got out and they didn't. I'm a big guy. I'm 268 pounds and I exercise
   and stay healthy and I just - I could not do a thing. It was just their
   time to go is the only way I can understand this.

   Losing a family is - I don't think there's any words for it. It kind of
   makes you wonder what life's all about. Many, many questions I have not
   received answers for yet. I just don't know what I feel these days. I
   wake up and go to my office and do my job and I come home. I've got the
   house full of their belongings and that I don't know what to do about.

   You know, when - as a father and a dad and a husband and everything,
   you always plan for the future of everybody, and it's just the opposite
   now. I have nobody to plan for or work on retirement for or save for
   buying a house or - it's just me.

   MONTAGNE: Douglas P. deSilvey of Gulfport, Mississippi.

   STEVE INSKEEP, host:

   Our next story takes us to New Orleans where David Duplantier can't
   forget what happened after the storm. The city police officer was
   separated from his wife, Melissa Eugene, who had evacuated. This
   morning they tell their stories together in a StoryCorps booth.

   On the night Katrina hit, David Duplantier was working at the
   Superdome.

   Mr. DAVID DUPLANTIER (Hurricane Katrina Survivor): As the night
   progressed, we started seeing a hole starting to form in the roof of
   the dome. And then this roof literally looked like an eggshell; it
   started to peel. And at that point was when everybody knew, okay, it's
   here. It's hitting us now.

   It wasn't a place, really, where people could find refuge. I mean, as
   the days went on, the water continued to rise, so you couldn't go back
   out. And the people never stopped coming in.

   There was a point where we were trying to get the evacuation going. And
   the one image that haunts me to this day, there was a woman that broke
   through the crowd and she had a little boy in her arms and he was
   convulsing. And she was screaming that he was sick and I kept asking
   her, do you need water? And she was trying to tell me what was wrong
   with him. And she kept looking at me to do something. And she kept
   asking me, well, where are the doctors? And I told her they were gone.

   Ms. MELISSA EUGENE (Wife of David Duplantier; Hurricane Katrina
   Survivor): Do you know what happened to her?

   Mr. DUPLANTIER: No, I don't know what happened.

   Ms. EUGENE: What were you thinking all those days being apart and not
   knowing?

   Mr. DUPLANTIER: All I wanted to do was let you know that I wasn't dead;
   I was alive. I never slept. In eight days I don't know how many hours I
   may have gotten, and at night that's all I thought about was you. I
   just wanted to get back to you - go back to life again. The whole thing
   felt like a really bad dream.

   I remembered it was very early on a Sunday morning and they told us
   that we could go and check on our loved ones, and I remember just
   feeling like I just escaped. I just wanted to get away and get to you.
   And I remember your smell when I first saw you. Man, I got drunk off
   your smell.

   Ms. EUGENE: That was the happiest day of my life.

   Mr. DUPLANTIER: Me, too.

   Ms. EUGENE: Are you glad that we decided to stay in New Orleans?

   Mr. DUPLANTIER: Yeah, this is home. And until it completely falls
   apart, if that ever happens, then we'll be here. Are you glad to be
   here?

   Ms. EUGENE: I'm very glad to be here. You can't replace this place.
   It's just -it's a part of who we are.

   Mr. DUPLANTIER: Yeah. I'm sorry for not talking about this with you
   before. It's weird because I find myself sitting down and I hear a song
   or I watch something on TV and I feel myself becoming full. And I think
   I'm just trying to put a lot of stuff in the back of my mind and try
   and forget about it. So when you ask I don't mean to be vague, it's
   just hard.

   Ms. EUGENE: I know.

   INSKEEP: That's David Duplantier with his wife Melissa Eugene at
   StoryCorps in New Orleans. These two stories and others from Katrina
   survivors are at npr.org. And, of course, all StoryCorps interviews are
   archived at the Library of Congress.
