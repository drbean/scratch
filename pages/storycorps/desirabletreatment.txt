When Charles turned 50, he started having problems with memory at work and home. He couldn't remember how to get to work, and he couldn't remember if he had eaten breakfast or not. Other people were the first to notice. His wife, Carol didn't know much about Alzheimer's but she knew that Charles' mother had had Alzheimer's.

She asked him to get diagnosed. When the doctors told him he had Alzheimer's, he already knew was the condition was like, as a result of his experience with his mother. He knew what was going to happen. He would gradually forget everything and stop doing things and would just sit in a chair all day. That was helpful to him. He didn't feel as worried as he might have about what was going to happen to him.

A friend, Brenda sent him an email after she found out. She thought the idea of losing your mind was horrible, and felt disturbed that Charles was going to turn into this kind of person. He said he was less worried, and he asked her not to stop being a friend.

He thought that the condition itself was not as bad as the treatment that people with Alzheimer's get from their family and friends. He remembered his father's treatment of his mother, and hoped that his wife and his children would not treat him the same way as that. He wanted them to treat him the same way as they always had. He wanted them to love him and to understand that even though he might act differently, he was still the same person inside and he was still having fun with them.
