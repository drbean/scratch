blurb: |+
         <p>
         <a href=http://www.storycorps.org>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
         <br>
         A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

    title: Cultural events
    intro: What are some events where people get together and celebrate something? Christmas is one. In the West, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Christmas</a> is a family event, especially significant for children because it's the one occasion in the year, besides birthdays, when they get new toys. Some families intentionally mislead children, having them believe Santa Claus really exists. Putting presents under a decorated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree">Christmas tree</a> and opening them on Christmas morning is an important part of Christmas.

It was one of the five deadliest in US history, the sixth strongest in recorded Atlantic hurricanes, and the costliest ($85 billion) in US history. 1,836 people were confirmed dead. Most severe loss of life occurred in New Orleans, where the levee system failed, and 80 percent of the city was flooded. However worst property damage occurred in Mississippi gulf towns where flood waters reached 10-20 kilometers from the beach.

        blurb: Sam Reed, an undertaker and caretaker of <a href="http://www.oaklandcemetery.com/">Historic Oakland Cemetery</a> in Atlanta, Georgia speaks of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120127584">life as an undertaker</a>.
        comment: In the United States, the casket with the dead body is often left open and people go up to pay their last respects. Because the body is often not pleasant to look at after death, a mortician will often put makeup on the face to make the face easier to look at. In England and Australia, the casket (or coffin) is kept closed. What do you think about these practices?

        comment: The vocabulary is simple but what they are saying is not. They also speak quite quickly and they are not trying to pronounce what they say clearly. They know each other well. They worked together for nearly 10 years. The story reminds me of that of the doorman at the Plaza, Ed Trinka, but Ed was speaking a lot more clearly. He was talking to a woman, who he did not know so well.
