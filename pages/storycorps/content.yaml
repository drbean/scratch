        blurb: |
          What do Ron and Ed have in common? I think it's a concern about relationships with other people. I summarized my feelings about the two, read <a href=http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/kroenkeandtrinka.mp3>here</a> by the "inhuman" voice of the <a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>>Festival Text-to-Speech system</a>.

        blurb: Sam Reed, an undertaker and caretaker of <a href="http://www.oaklandcemetery.com/">Historic Oakland Cemetery</a> in Atlanta, Georgia speaks of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120127584">life as an undertaker</a>.
        comment: In the United States, the casket with the dead body is often left open and people go up to pay their last respects. Because the body is often not pleasant to look at after death, a mortician will often put makeup on the face to make the face easier to look at. In England and Australia, the casket (or coffin) is kept closed. What do you think about these practices?

          The homework is shorter than before. I have divided the sound file up into 4 parts. Listen to the whole of the sound file, but just fill in part of it. Do this homework by November 27, ie <b>2 weeks' time</b>. It is worth one point to your grade.
