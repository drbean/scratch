blurb: |+
         <p>
         <a href=http://www.storycorps.org>Storycorps</a> is an American project to record the stories of everyday Americans. You can hear them each Friday morning on <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4516989>NPR radio.</a>
         <br>
         A lot of the stories are not difficult to understand. So they are suitable for people learning English. At the same time, they are real stories, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

    title: People with disabilities
    intro: A disability is the absence of some ability that normal people have. Disabilities can be mental, eg very low intelligence, or physical, eg, an inability to walk or to see. Dr Bean's inability to speak Chinese, a language he did not learn as a child is not regarded as a disability (but it should be :-) How do people with disabilities cope?

          <li>I think listening to her is disturbing. How do you feel? Is she easy to understand? She says that life is better for her now than it was before. What do you think? Would you like to have an artificial voice?

        title: Cuban immigrant
        blurb: Gus Mestas left Cuba for the U.S. in 1963, more than 10 years before Theresa Nguyen left Vietnam, but under similar circumstances, fleeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba</a> under the Communist regime of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro">Fidel_Castro</a>. Life as a Cuban exile wasn't easy. In Cuba, he was a doctor. But his qualifications as a doctor weren't recognized in the US. He tells his daughter, Ileana about <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92650667">his struggle to make a life for himself and his family in the U.S.</a>
        comment: Not only in the U.S. are immigrants' qualifications not recognized. The same occurs in Canada, Australia and Europe. It is very difficult for immigrants to get the same kind of job they had in their home countries.

        title: Being poor
        blurb: When he was about 8, Noe Rueda started selling things on the street to help his mom, and he also worked on a construction site when he was in elementary school. He <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/15/135415519/a-young-sons-goal-making-money-for-his-mother">talks with a teacher</a> about the experience.
        comment: What ethnic group in the US does Noe come from? You should be able to tell from the name of his teacher. Children working to support their families sounds like something from the <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/childlabor/">the past</a> in the U.S. Clearly, however, some people there are still very poor.

    title: Cultural events
    intro: What are some events where people get together and celebrate something? Christmas is one. In the West, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas">Christmas</a> is a family event, especially significant for children because it's the one occasion in the year, besides birthdays, when they get new toys. Some families intentionally mislead children, having them believe Santa Claus really exists. Putting presents under a decorated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree">Christmas tree</a> and opening them on Christmas morning is an important part of Christmas.

    intro: The hurricane lasted August 23-30, 2005. It was one of the five deadliest in US history, the sixth strongest in recorded Atlantic hurricanes, and the costliest ($85 billion) in US history. 1,836 people were confirmed dead. Most severe loss of life occurred in New Orleans, where the levee system failed, and 80 percent of the city was flooded. However worst property damage occurred in Mississippi gulf towns where flood waters reached 10-20 kilometers from the beach.

She also had to make tough decisions about her children, her marriage and her career. She wanted to give 100 percent to all three. But that was not possible.
        comment: She says that things were not good in the 1970's when she was young. But she says men still think the same. The only difference is that they are more careful about how they express themselves, ie they are more subtle.

        comment: In the United States, the casket with the dead body is often left open and people go up to pay their last respects. Because the body is often not pleasant to look at after death, a mortician will often put makeup on the face to make the face easier to look at. In England and Australia, the casket (or coffin) is kept closed. What do you think about these practices?

        comment: The vocabulary is simple but what they are saying is not. They also speak quite quickly and they are not trying to pronounce what they say clearly. They know each other well. They worked together for nearly 10 years. The story reminds me of that of the doorman at the Plaza, Ed Trinka, but Ed was speaking a lot more clearly. He was talking to a woman, who he did not know so well.
