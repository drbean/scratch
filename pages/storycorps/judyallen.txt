# Welcome to the StoryCorps podcast. In this episode, we hear from Judy Allen. Judy lives in Portland, Oregon. When she visited her daughter, Kelly Edwards in New York City, they stopped by our booth in Grand Central Terminal. During the interview, Judy reflected on the large events in her life. Here she remembers a time 20 years ago, when her marriage was coming to an end.

Time now for another moment from StoryCorps. StoryCorps is a national oral history project. Friends and family members talk about their lives in a StoryCorps recording booth. Some of their stories are heard Fridays on Morning Edition.

Judy Allen is sixty-five years old and lives in Portland, Oregon. Her daughter, Kelly Edwards is forty four, and  interviewed her mom in the StoryCorps booth at New York's Grand Central Terminal.

Kelly: Describe a memory when you felt independent and empowered.
Judy: I think the most empowered I've ever felt in my life was when my philandering husband told me he was going to work and I suddenly realized he'd gone to be with his girlfriend. I went to where she was staying, and found his car parked in front of her house, got a great big rock about as big as a bowling ball from somebody's garden, and heaved it through the back window of his car.

That was wonderful. It felt great. And then I started divorce proceedings.

Years later he called.. he sent me a message somehow, and told me that he still had some stuff of mine--books and things--that if I was ever traveling in Alaska, I should stop by and pick them up. And I was doing a business trip to Alaska, so I went up there, made an appointment, went to see him in his office, and he handed me a very heavy box, and said 'There's a lot of heavy stuff--books and stuff--in there'. And so I dragged it and schlepped it through airports all the way home. God, it was heavy. And then I got home and opened it up and, nothing in it but that rock. Which he had saved all those years.
