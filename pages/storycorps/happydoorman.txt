Ed Trinka worked as a doorman at the Plaza Hotel, a very old and very famous hotel in New York. His job was to greet guests as they came into the hotel, help them get out of their cars, and help them with their bags. This was very simple to do.

But he also had to do something which was more difficult to do. That was the job of making guests feel important and happy about staying at the Plaza. Ed did a very good job of this, because he was a happy and friendly person.

He didn't do this because the boss, Shane, said he had to. He did it because he liked people. One time, a guest wanted his shoes shined very early in the morning, before the shoe shine stand was open, so he shone the shoes himself, not because the boss said he had to, but because Ed just wanted to help.

He just made people around him feel happy, even when they weren't very happy before seeing him. Someone like Jackie Gleason was not a happy person, even though he made other people laugh. He used to make Jackie Gleason feel happy, so Gleason gave him very big tips. And, he was friendly even with people passing in the street like Debra Goodman.
