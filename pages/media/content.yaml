        title: Phone hacking scandal closes newspaper
        blurb: |
          News of the World was a famous newspaper in England where reporters felt <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14078182">they had to, or it was OK to,</a> hack the phones of people in the news. This became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal">The News International phone hacking scandal</a>, where people claim the owner, Rupert Murdoch, was responsible. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html?pagewanted=all"> NY Times report on phone hacking by News of the World. </a>  Police were involved. The head of the Metropolitan Police resigned, but before resigning, he asked Elizabeth Filkin to investigate what was the appropriate relationship between reporters and the police.

        title: TV show hosts square off over illegal immigration
        blurb: |
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Reilly_(political_commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera">Geraldo Rivera</a> are news show hosts on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a> cable and satellite TV news channel owned by Rupert Murdoch. Fox News is extremely popular with conservative Americans, and extremely unpopular with liberal leftists, the White House and other Democrats.

          Listen to Rivera and O'Reilly argue about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3U9ENaTPLY">an illegal alien who killed a woman while driving drunk.</a> O'Reilly said the man should be deported to Mexico. Rivera was angry with the way O'Reilly reported the story. He said it was a drunk driving story, not an illegal alien story. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States">Illegal aliens in the US</a> is a controversial topic there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs">Lou Dobbs</a>, another news caster who Rivera criticizes for being very opposed to illegal immigration, now also works for Fox News.
