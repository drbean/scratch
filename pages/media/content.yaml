        title: Phone hacking scandal closes newspaper
        blurb: |
          News of the World was a famous newspaper in England where reporters felt <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14078182">they had to, or it was OK to,</a> hack the phones of people in the news. This became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal">The News International phone hacking scandal</a>, where people claim the owner, Rupert Murdoch, was responsible. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05hacking-t.html?pagewanted=all"> NY Times report on phone hacking by News of the World. </a>  Police were involved. The head of the Metropolitan Police resigned, but before resigning, he asked Elizabeth Filkin to investigate what was the appropriate relationship between reporters and the police.

        title: TV show hosts square off over illegal immigration
        blurb: |
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Reilly_(political_commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera">Geraldo Rivera</a> are news show hosts on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a> cable and satellite TV news channel owned by Rupert Murdoch. Fox News is extremely popular with conservative Americans, and extremely unpopular with liberal leftists, the White House and other Democrats.

          Listen to Rivera and O'Reilly argue about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3U9ENaTPLY">an illegal alien who killed a woman while driving drunk.</a> O'Reilly said the man should be deported to Mexico. Rivera was angry with the way O'Reilly reported the story. He said it was a drunk driving story, not an illegal alien story. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States">Illegal aliens in the US</a> is a controversial topic there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs">Lou Dobbs</a>, another news caster who Rivera criticizes for being very opposed to illegal immigration, now also works for Fox News.

        title: Radio host insults woman, divides public
        blurb: |
          Talk show host <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> has the most popular radio talk show in the US. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh_%E2%80%93_Sandra_Fluke_controversy">On February 29</a>, he used a very bad word to describe a woman who wanted her Catholic university to provide the birth pill to students for free. Obama called the woman, Sandra Fluke, to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_S2k0rNiQ4">give her his support.</a> Listen to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAopvhyZ4yg">broadcast</a>.

          Conservatives enjoy Limbaugh, although they may not take him seriously. Liberals can't stand him. Both sides call him an "entertainer", "buffoon" or "clown."

        title: Radio personality calls for faith in Obama's legitimacy
        blurb: |
          Talk show host <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern">Howard Stern</a> expresses views at the opposite end of the political spectrum to those of Limbaugh, and at the leftish end of those that can be heard on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_in_the_United_States">U.S. radio</a>. But like Limbaugh, he is a user (an even worse user) of bad language. Listen to him <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek-G_TYvyck">call 'Birthers' moronic and even worse.</a> A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories">Birther</a> is someone who doubts whether Obama is really a 'natural-born American.'

          Listen to him. Whose views are you closer to? Stern's or Limbaugh's

        title: Bill O'Reilly interviews Howard Stern
        blurb: |
          Stern and O'Reilly are both from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Long Island</a>, but disagree about many things. Stern is a liberal. O'Reilly is a conservative. But perhaps many of the things they discuss in the interview are not real disagreements. They just disagree to make the interview more interesting. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3hVhmX1jOE">Listen</a>. You decide if their disagreements are real.
