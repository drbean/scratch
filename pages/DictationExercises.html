<h2>The Aim</h2>
<br>

Listening to native-speaker speech is difficult, because we don't know enough about the language and the culture to understand what they are saying easily.
<br>

If we can get some help, however, it is often a lot easier.
<br>

The problem is that the support people give us, by translating or having us read a script, often stops us doing any work at all, trying to understand.
<br>

This means that we don't do any learning at all.
<br>

The trick is to get a little support and think about how that relates to what is being said. In addition, there needs to be a feedback loop between the support being provided and our efforts to understand. That is, the support needs to be interactive.
<br>

The aim of these dictation exercises is to provide that support with clues to the meaning of what is being said, in the form of the emerging text of the spoken word, as it is transcribed (the blanks are filled in), by the listener.
<br>

Because written texts are usually more easily understandable than the spoken word, division of the spoken text into words, partially spelling some of these words and asking listeners to fill in the rest provides a dynamic scaffolding on which they can work top-down and bottom up to achieve fuller understanding of the whole text.
<br>

However, dictation has its limitations. Knowing what has been said is different than understanding what has been said. If you can write down what has been said, but don't understand what it means, then the exercises have failed to provide you the support you need.
<br>

Comprehension questions can be asked to get round this problem. If the listener listens to the question, it becomes a part of the dictation exercise, and a part of the same challenge.
<br>

The challenge of the dictation activity is like that of the kindergarten activity of knocking pegs into holes in a block of wood. The aim there is to get the round peg into the round hole and the square peg into the square hole. This is motivating and pleasant for the child when achieved. In the same way, seeing the word typed into the blank in the web form being accepted by the computer is enjoyable for the listener of a second language.

	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
