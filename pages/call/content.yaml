title: Computer and Multimedia-Assisted Language Teaching
blurb: |+
         <p>
         This course is about using the computer and multimedia to learn English.
         <br>
         Dr Bean thinks when we talk about the computer and multimedia we can talk indirectly about learning, something which is difficult to do directly.

    title: Using the computer to sequence flash cards
    intro: Flash cards are/were small cards with a word on one side and the translation on the other. Nowadays the computer is used to space repetition of forgotten words more frequently and remembered words less frequently. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard</a>.

        title: Baseline for learning of Academic Word List sublists 1-3
        blurb: |
          We now will learn the 180 words from the first 3 Academic Wordlist sublists for the midterm exam, using Anki or Mnemosyne. But first we need to establish what the base level is.
        comment: To do this, we will guess the meanings (in Chinese) of the words, or if we know them, just write them in.

        title: Upload your deck of cards to Mnemosyne or Anki
        blurb: |
          We studied 180 words from the Academic Wordlist, but it is better to study words you want to learn, rather than someone else wants you learn. Make a deck of cards of words you want to study and upload them to Mnemosyne or Anki so other people can study them also.
        comment: |
          Creating the deck of cards. Make 10 or more cards.
