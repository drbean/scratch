        title: Who will help the refugees?
        blurb: |
          Shen says we shouldn't just help anyone who wants help. The people of Taiwan gave US$216 million to help Japan after the earthquake in 2011, Should the Taiwanese people have done that? Japan is a very rich country and can help itself. Should the people in Taiwan have helped poor people in Africa instead?

        title: What can be done about traffic problems?
        blurb: |
          Does Taipei have a traffic problem? Does Miaoli have one? Taiwanese roads are not good for driving on. But even countries with good roads, like the US, have traffic problems. What do you think should be done to make the roads better? Although motor scooters use less energy than cars, I think they are a problem. More people in Taiwan should ride bicycles.
        comment: Listen to Richard Day, the main author of the Impact series discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/authors_introductionmp3/tm2_u2.mp3">his views of traffic jams</a>. He uses these words: focus, vehicle, innovative, status symbol, "When you get right down to it,".

        title: Government population control
        blurb: |
          What is the Taiwan government doing about population control? Years ago, families were encouraged to have fewer children. Now there are not enough children being born. What should the government do? Do you believe the government should order families to have children (or to not have children, in the case of mainland China)?
        comment: Listen to Todd discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_14.mov">what governments should make people do</a>. He uses these words: aging societies, population control, fines for childless couples, striking the right balance between advising and regulating, and not going overboard.

        blurb: |
          Men and women try to make a <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/FirstImpressions.htm">good first impression</a> by not acting the way they normally act. Is that OK? How should a man and a woman <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-13-2005-64103.asp">act toward each other</a> when they are talking together for the first time?
        comment: Listen to Sara on the Impact series website <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_1.mov">criticize women who don't want to appear intelligent</a> or who won't express their opinion. Or find the file on <a href="http://ec.must.edu.tw">http://ec.must.edu.tw</a>. The second section is a repeat of the first section but with some words that are not on the soundfile. Try to guess what they are.

        title: Two men rumored to be gay
        blurb: |
         Sometimes people misunderstand relationships. Unit 12's story is about two men who are close friends. Some people think they are gay, because they spend a lot of time together, and less time with other people. What do you think?
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to Steve <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_13.mov">describe how a friend thought he was gay, when he wasn't</a>. Someone used Steve's computer to play a joke on him. This unknown person sent an email to the male friend proposing a sexual relationship. Steve is embarrassed telling this story. It may be difficult for you to understand what he is talking about.

        id: cohabitation
        title: Living together
        blurb: |
         Should you live with your 'significant other' outside marriage? Your parents may be opposed to you doing this. They worry that you may break up with that person, and then find it difficult to get married to someone else. In the case of the story in Impact Issues, the guy wants his girlfriend to move in with him, but she doesn't want to, because her parents are opposed to it.
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to (or download) the video of <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_15.mov">Derek saying the two individuals involved in the relationship are the only people who should decide</a>. Look out for the difficult vocabulary: <ul><li>cohabitation (meaning living together), <li>ultimately (finally), <li>an era different from their own (meaning life is different for you than it was for your parents' generation), <li>value systems (the things people believe in and think important, <li>open the doors (allow).</ul>

        blurb: |
         How do people in Taiwan find a partner, someone who they want to have a family with? Does someone from their family introduce them to a suitable husband/wife/ Or do they find someone themselves, someone who they fall in love with?
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to (or download) the video of <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_18.mov">Mei saying the two ways of finding the right one to marry are both good</a>. Mei uses the terms: <ul><li>introduced marriages (meaning a parent introduces them to someone), <li>and love marriages (meaning they fall in love with someone and then (usually) get the approval of their parents)</ul>. Another term for introduced marriage is arranged marriage. Another for love marriages is love-match marriages.
