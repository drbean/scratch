        title: What can be done about traffic problems?
        blurb: |
          Does Taipei have a traffic problem? Does Miaoli have one? Taiwanese roads are not good for driving on. But even countries with good roads, like the US, have traffic problems. What do you think should be done to make the roads better? Although motor scooters use less energy than cars, I think they are a problem. More people in Taiwan should ride bicycles.
        comment: Listen to Richard Day, the main author of the Impact series discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/authors_introductionmp3/tm2_u2.mp3">his views of traffic jams</a>. He uses these words: focus, vehicle, innovative, status symbol, "When you get right down to it,".

        blurb: |
          In the textbook, in Unit 3, Peter, an Australian is <a href="http://www.learningthai.com">learning Thai</a>. Richard, an American is not. How important is it that foreigners learn the local language. How important is it that local people learn English?

        title: Do women act "unnaturally" meeting men, because men are afraid of intelligent women?
        blurb: |
          Men and women try to make a <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/FirstImpressions.htm">good first impression</a> by not acting the way they normally act. Is that OK? How should a man and a woman <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-13-2005-64103.asp">act toward each other</a> when they are talking together for the first time?
        comment: Listen to Sara on the Impact series website <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_1.mov">criticize women who don't want to appear intelligent</a> or who won't express their opinion.
