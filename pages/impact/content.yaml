        title: What can be done about traffic problems?
        blurb: |
          Does Taipei have a traffic problem? Does Miaoli have one? Taiwanese roads are not good for driving on. But even countries with good roads, like the US, have traffic problems. What do you think should be done to make the roads better? Although motor scooters use less energy than cars, I think they are a problem. More people in Taiwan should ride bicycles.
        comment: Listen to Richard Day, the main author of the Impact series discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/authors_introductionmp3/tm2_u2.mp3">his views of traffic jams</a>. He uses these words: focus, vehicle, innovative, status symbol, "When you get right down to it,".

        title: Should foreigners learn the local language?
        blurb: |
          In the textbook, in Unit 3, Peter, an Australian is <a href="http://www.learningthai.com">learning Thai</a>. Richard, an American is not. How important is it that foreigners learn the local language. How important is it that local people learn English?
        comment: Listen to Scott on the Impact series website <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_3.mov">criticize expatriates</a> who don't want to learn the local language.

        title: Do women act "unnaturally" meeting men, because men are afraid of intelligent women?
        blurb: |
          Men and women try to make a <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/FirstImpressions.htm">good first impression</a> by not acting the way they normally act. Is that OK? How should a man and a woman <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-13-2005-64103.asp">act toward each other</a> when they are talking together for the first time?
        comment: Listen to Sara on the Impact series website <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_1.mov">criticize women who don't want to appear intelligent</a> or who won't express their opinion.

        title: International marriage--a big problem
        blurb: |
         In the textbook, in Unit 11, Akane, a Japanese artist has a Finnish boyfriend, but neither wants to live in the other's country. The situation is similar to that of Dr Bean. He doesn't want to live in Japan and his Japanese wife doesn't want to live in Taiwan. What should they do?

        title: Two men rumored to be gay
        blurb: |
         Sometimes people misunderstand relationships. Unit 12's story is about two men who are close friends. Some people think they are gay, because they spend a lot of time together, and less time with other people. What do you think?
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to Steve <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_13.mov">describe how a friend thought he was gay, when he wasn't</a>. Someone used Steve's computer to play a joke on him. This unknown person sent an email to the male friend proposing a sexual relationship. Steve is embarrassed telling this story. It may be difficult for you to understand what he is talking about.
