        blurb: |
          Many people, especially women, think they are overweight when they are not really overweight. But also some people really <b>are</b> overweight. How do you feel about your weight and your appearance?
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to Junko Yamanaka, one of the authors of the Impact series discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/authors_introductionmp3/tm2_u16.mp3">being overweight</a>. Then, listen to (or download) the video of <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_16.mov">Andrea saying that self-confidence makes people look beautiful</a>. Look out for the difficult vocabulary: <ul><li>exude (meaning, to come out of your skin like water) <li>root of beauty (meaning, what makes someone beautiful), <li>see someone in a different light (meaning, change the way you think about someone), <li>scenario (meaning, a story).</ul>

        id: traffic
        title: What can be done about traffic problems?
        blurb: |
          Does Taipei have a traffic problem? Does Miaoli have one? Taiwanese roads are not good for driving on. But even countries with good roads, like the US, have traffic problems. What do you think should be done to make the roads better? Although motor scooters use less energy than cars, I think they are a problem. More people in Taiwan should ride bicycles.
        comment: Listen to Richard Day, the main author of the Impact series discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/authors_introductionmp3/tm2_u2.mp3">his views of traffic jams</a>. He uses these words: focus, vehicle, innovative, status symbol, "When you get right down to it,".

        id: control
        title: Government population control
        blurb: |
          What is the Taiwan government doing about population control? Years ago, families were encouraged to have fewer children. Now there are not enough children being born. What should the government do? Do you believe the government should order families to have children (or to not have children, in the case of mainland China)?
        comment: Listen to Todd discuss <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_14.mov">what governments should make people do</a>. He uses these words: aging societies, population control, fines for childless couples, striking the right balance between advising and regulating, and not going overboard.

        title: Do women act "unnaturally" meeting men, because men are afraid of intelligent women?
        blurb: |
          Men and women try to make a <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/FirstImpressions.htm">good first impression</a> by not acting the way they normally act. Is that OK? How should a man and a woman <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-13-2005-64103.asp">act toward each other</a> when they are talking together for the first time?
        comment: Listen to Sara on the Impact series website <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_1.mov">criticize women who don't want to appear intelligent</a> or who won't express their opinion.

        title: International marriage--a big problem
        blurb: |
         In the textbook, in Unit 11, Akane, a Japanese artist has a Finnish boyfriend, but neither wants to live in the other's country. The situation is similar to that of Dr Bean. He doesn't want to live in Japan and his Japanese wife doesn't want to live in Taiwan. What should they do?

        title: Two men rumored to be gay
        blurb: |
         Sometimes people misunderstand relationships. Unit 12's story is about two men who are close friends. Some people think they are gay, because they spend a lot of time together, and less time with other people. What do you think?
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to Steve <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_13.mov">describe how a friend thought he was gay, when he wasn't</a>. Someone used Steve's computer to play a joke on him. This unknown person sent an email to the male friend proposing a sexual relationship. Steve is embarrassed telling this story. It may be difficult for you to understand what he is talking about.

        id: cohabitation
        title: Living together
        blurb: |
         Should you live with your 'significant other' outside marriage? Your parents may be opposed to you doing this. They worry that you may break up with that person, and then find it difficult to get married to someone else. In the case of the story in Impact Issues, the guy wants his girlfriend to move in with him, but she doesn't want to, because her parents are opposed to it.
        comment: From  <a href="http://impactseries.com">http://impactseries.com</a>, listen to (or download) the video of <a href="http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/2_15.mov">Derek saying the two individuals involved in the relationship are the only people who should decide</a>. Look out for the difficult vocabulary: <ul><li>cohabitation (meaning living together), <li>ultimately (finally), <li>an era different from their own (meaning life is different for you than it was for your parents' generation), <li>value systems (the things people believe in and think important, <li>open the doors (allow).</ul>
