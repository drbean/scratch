Last Friday, Regina Lee (李蕙丞) was talking about how black people in the US wouldn't look at her. But do <b>Taiwanese</b> people look at <b>Americans</b> the "right way"? In particular, are there differences between the US and Taiwan in when people smile. I remember the wife of a Taiwanese professor laughing when she saw I had hurt my back. She made me feel very bad!

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a> for the spelling.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
</ul>
