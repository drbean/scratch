<b>Chinese as a Second Language Teachers.</b>

<p>
<h2>New Topics</h2>
<br>

Watch this <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzTUYAOkPM>60-year-old teaching demonstration video</a> of a <b>bad</b> teacher. He criticizes the students and maintains discipline by bad methods. But he then turns into a <b>good</b> teacher and keeps the students' minds on the subject he is teaching, avoiding discipline problems.
<br>
What do you think? What is good and what is bad in the classroom? How do students act nowadays? Is it the same as 60 years ago? Is the teacher really better in the second half of the video?
<br>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>discipline</b> exercise.

<h2>Old Topics</h2>
<br>

Sometimes lessons don't go well. Perhaps the students won't <b>settle down</b>. Or perhaps, they get <b>out of hand</b>. Listen to <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oehUnEw7ZMs>an angry, upset teacher</a> from <a href=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=teacher&aq=f>Youtube</a>.
<br>
What do you think is the reason for the problem? What do you think of what the girl says at the end? How can this problem be avoided? Have you ever been sent out of the room?
<br>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>mad</b> exercise.
</p>


Are you ready to teach in schools where the students don't want to learn Chinese? Listen to what <a href=http://www.pbs.org/merrow/tv/leadership/dc/segment8.html>Darrin Slade</a>, a principal in a Washington DC school, says about <a href=http://www.pbs.org/merrow/tv/leadership/dc/segment8.html>giving 100 percent</a> in teaching in difficult circumstances.
<br>
Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>100percent</b> exercise.
</p>

<p>
Is there still an error message when you answer the question? Does it tell you if you got the right answer or not?

<h2>Logging in</h2>

</p>

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. The first letter of the password is a capital letter. The spelliing of the U in 育 is a big U, not a small u.  See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
