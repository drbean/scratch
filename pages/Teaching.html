<b>Chinese as a Second Language Teachers.</b> 
</p>

<p>
<h2>New Topics</h2>
</p>

<p>
This week, The second video in the <a href=http://www.youtube.com/user/Rubiconatlas>Schools and the City series</a>. Again, they are comparing fashion to assessment. Teachers are not happy with <b>how often</b> they have to assess students. In particular, they are unhappy with the over-frequent <b>summative</b> tests. The video is called <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNKbZ1Yf3rQ>Fashionable Frequency in Assessment</a>.
</p>

<p>
How is assessment like fashion? Listen to the fashion idioms, <a href=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=strut+stuff>strut your stuff</a>, <a href=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22what%27s+hot+and+what%27s+not%22&btnG=Google+Search>What's hot and what's not</a>.

<p>
American middle school students' <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcfO0VWg7mE&feature=channel_page>school video</a>. The teacher is chasing the students to the bathroom.
<br>
Do you think the teacher is angry? Do you think the students really stole something from her desk? If the door hadn't been locked would the teacher have run into the bathroom?

<br>
<a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>Login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>pe-2</b> exercise.
</p>


<h2>Old Topics</h2>
<br>

<p>
This week, we watch a <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgBjq1EsDHU&feature=related>cartoon version</a> of the 60-year-old teaching demonstration video we watched last week. The cartoon version is even more horrible. The teacher uses a gun to make the students feel fear.
<br>
What do you think? Do you think the cartoon is funny? Why would someone try to make fun of teachers this way? What is it about teachers that makes people afraid?
</p>

<p>
Watch this <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzTUYAOkPM>60-year-old teaching demonstration video</a> of a <b>bad</b> teacher. He criticizes the students and maintains discipline by bad methods. But he then turns into a <b>good</b> teacher and keeps the students' minds on the subject he is teaching, avoiding discipline problems.
<br>
What do you think? What is good and what is bad in the classroom? How do students act nowadays? Is it the same as 60 years ago? Is the teacher really better in the second half of the video?
</p>


<p>
Sometimes lessons don't go well. Perhaps the students won't <b>settle down</b>. Or perhaps, they get <b>out of hand</b>. Listen to <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oehUnEw7ZMs>an angry, upset teacher</a> from <a href=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=teacher&aq=f>Youtube</a>.
<br>
What do you think is the reason for the problem? What do you think of what the girl says at the end? How can this problem be avoided? Have you ever been sent out of the room?
</p>


<p>
Are you ready to teach in schools where the students don't want to learn Chinese? Listen to what <a href=http://www.pbs.org/merrow/tv/leadership/dc/segment8.html>Darrin Slade</a>, a principal in a Washington DC school, says about <a href=http://www.pbs.org/merrow/tv/leadership/dc/segment8.html>giving 100 percent</a> in teaching in difficult circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Is there still an error message when you answer the question? Does it tell you if you got the right answer or not?

<p>
Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. The first letter of the password is a capital letter. The spelliing of the U in 育 is a big U, not a small u.  See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
