<p>
<b>Chinese as a Second Language Teachers.</b> 

<a href=http://www.pbs.org/merrow/podcast/redir/merrow/rss/media/84.mp3>Listen</a> to a beginning teacher talk about the energy needed in a difficult school situation in New Orleans on <a href=http://pbs.org/merrow/>Learning Matters</a> on the US <a href=http://pbs.org/>PBS</a> public broadcasting TV network.

<br>
Do you think new teachers understand the demands that will be placed on them? Are you ready for disappointment and frustration when your efforts to do a good job don't have any effect?
</p>
<p>

Then <a href=http://203.64.184.141/cgi-bin/dic/script_files/dic_cgi.pl/login>login</a> and fill in the blanks in the <b>energy</b> exercise.
</p>

<p>
Is there still an error message when you answer the question? Does it tell you if you got the right answer or not?
</p>

Note: You need to login to transcribe the conversation.
<ul>
	<li>Your name is your Chinese name in Chinese characters. Your ID is your school ID. 
	<li>The first letter of the ID, eg U or N, is a capital (big) letter. 
	<li>Your password is the first half of your first name. It is in English, not the Chinese character. Thus JiaQi's pasword is Jia. The first letter of the password is a capital letter. The spelliing of the U in 育 is a big U, not a small u.  See <a href=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/syllabary>Lin YuTang's Chinese-English dictionary</a>.
	<li>If I was not able to find the first character in your name, your password may be a question mark. Eg, 賴?岑. Other people whose names my computer does not have Chinese characters for are 黃慧? and ?琮婷, but their passwords should be okay.
	<li>If you have any problem email me at drbean at (@) freeshell dot (.) org, or come and see me in the Self-Access Learning Room.
