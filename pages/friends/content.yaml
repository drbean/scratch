blurb: |+
         <p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends>Friends</a> was an American sitcom, which ran from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004. 
         <br>
         It was, and is still, <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/> very popular</a>.
         <br>
         A lot of the language is simple, although it may be fast. Anyway, it is suitable for people learning English. At the same time, it is funny, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

         Chandler needs Ross's support to help him <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ESeEZD_OY>quit the gym</a>.
        comment: Why? Does he like the people there and feel embarrassed about disappointing them? Is he afraid that he will change his mind and continue to belong to the gym? Is he afraid that the people at the gym will be angry and try to humiliate him or even physically abuse him?

          Ross is trying to date Elizabeth, his student, but Elizabeth's father, Paul, who is dating Rachel, says he will get him fired until Ross threatens to reveals Paul's self-identification as Rachel's 'love machine.' Meanwhile Joey misses an audition and breaks his fridge. He asks Chandler and Ross to pay for a new one.
