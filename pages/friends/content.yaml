title: Friends--American TV sitcom
blurb: |+
         <p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends>Friends</a> was an American sitcom, which ran from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004. 
         <br>
         It was, and is still, <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/> very popular</a>.
         <br>
         A lot of the language is simple, although it may be fast. Anyway, it is suitable for people learning English. At the same time, it is funny, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

          Ross is trying to date Elizabeth, his student, but Elizabeth's father, Paul, who is dating Rachel, says he will get him fired until Ross threatens to reveals Paul's self-identification as Rachel's 'love machine.' Meanwhile Joey misses an audition and breaks his fridge. He asks Chandler and Ross to pay for a new one.

       title: Season 7, Episode 1. Rachel upset by Monica's engagement
       blurb: |
         At the end of the 6th season, Chandler and Monica got engaged. The seventh season is about preparation for the wedding. In the first show of the 7th season, Rachel feels romantic as a result of the engagement, and suggests to Ross they go to bed together. But Monica is mad with Rachel for wanting to go to bed with Ross. Monica and Rachel fight and then make up. Ross is the big loser.
       comment: Watch at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TskSEcpBRmY">Best of Ross</a>. Monica thinks Rachel was trying to <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/steal+thunder">steal her thunder</a> or <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/upstage">upstage</a> her.

        blurb: |
          <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPKMn28gvxw">Chandler as a funny guy</a>. Is Chandler funny or not? He wants to be funny, but that doesn't mean he IS funny. Even if HE isn't funny, the FACT HE ISN'T FUNNY can be funny, Joking about the difference between what people do and what they think about themselves can be funny in the West. The distinction exists elsewhere eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae">Japanese 本音 and 建前</a>. But is that distinction funny elsewhere? Do you find this episode funny?
