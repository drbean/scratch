         A lot of the language is simple, although it may be fast. Anyway, it is suitable for people learning English. At the same time, it is funny, moving, interesting, informative and likeable.

        blurb: |
         Chandler needs Ross's support to help him <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ESeEZD_OY>quit the gym</a>.
        comment: Why? Does he like the people there and feel embarrassed about disappointing them? Is he afraid that he will change his mind and continue to belong to the gym? Is he afraid that the people at the gym will be angry and try to humiliate him or even physically abuse him?

          Chandler is moving out of the apartment with Joey and moving in with Monica. Joey finds a woman to move in with him. Ross and Rachel are married to each other, but are trying to get a divorce or annulment, even though they like each other. Ross is trying to date other women, but he thinks he repels them.
