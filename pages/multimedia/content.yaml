title: Computer and Multimedia-Assisted Language Teaching
blurb: |+
         <p>
         This course is about using the computer and multimedia to learn English.
         <br>
         Dr Bean thinks when we talk about the computer and multimedia we can talk indirectly about learning, something which is difficult to do directly.

          We now will learn the 180 words from the first 3 Academic Wordlist sublists for the midterm exam, using Anki or Mnemosyne. But first we need to establish what the base level is.
        comment: To do this, we will guess the meanings (in Chinese) of the words, or if we know them, just write them in.

        comment: |
          The book and movie versions that have been published since have tried to make the story more interesting by adding events and characters. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222519/episodes">made-for-TV version</a> we see here has different characters and stories. Listen to clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ8Q86OVZoc">Episodes 1-3</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDFCBG7n_Xw">Episodes 4-6</a>.

        comment: There have been many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist_(disambiguation)">Oliver Twist movies</a>.

          The classic French historical adventure story, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_musketeers">The three musketeers</a> was written in the middle of the 19th century, partly based on real events in 17th century France. There are many cartoon and filmed versions. We will watch in order, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4euNVxFP-I">1. Mickey Mouse version</a>, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoKabmvTbwM">2. 1973 version</a> with d'Artagnan on the way to Paris to join the musketeers, a <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq6_FcTLrtY">3. 1993 Disney version</a> highlighted in the textbook, and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIonRf5yHIM">4. cartoon version</a>.
        comment: |
          Like Oliver Twist, the story is very complicated. The cartoon versions don't stick closely to the book, but the two filmed versions do follow the book.
