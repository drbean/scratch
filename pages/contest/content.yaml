    title: Cultural events
    intro: What are some events where people get together and celebrate something? Christmas is one. In the West, Christmas is a family event, especially significant for children because it's the one occasion in the year, besides birthdays, when they get new toys. Some families intentionally mislead children, having them believe Santa Claus really exists. Putting presents under a decorated Christmas tree and opening them on Christmas morning is an important part of Christmas.
