For homework this week, prepare a deck of 10 or more cards 
for words YOU want to learn.

Put them on Anki or Mnemosyne on a smart phone or a USB stick
and bring them on Friday to show to others in the class.

Put the words as a list on http://ec.must.edu.tw, just like 
I did with my Chinese character pronunciation list.
