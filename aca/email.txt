Bring a smart phone on Friday evening for the Mid-term exam.
We are going to be using smart phones to answer the vocabulary
questions again. There appears to be no computer lab we can use
to do the exam.

If you can't bring a smart phone to use to do the exam, please
reply to this email.

I don't have a smart phone, and I think probably a few of you
also don't have smart phones.

I need to know how many people won't be able to do the exam
on Friday evening.
