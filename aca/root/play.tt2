<H1>Welcome, [% player %], to the vocabulary quiz for the [% exercise %] Exercise in the [% league %] league.</H1>

<p>We have used Anki or Mnemosyne to learn 180 words. The difference between the number of words which you got wrong on the pre-test and which you get right now will be your grade for Exam 2 of the course.

<ul>
<li>Give a translation for every word. Save your work regularly by clicking 'Submit' and certainly click 'Submit' before closing your browser.
<li>Every translation must be different. Guessing is good, but they must be different guesses for each word.
<li>No surfing the net or consulting Anki or Mnemosyne, or the people sitting next to you.
</ul>
