        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Medication] Drugs are used to control symptoms, but have serious side effects. They have a good effect in 40-50 percent of cases, and no effect in 20 percent.
        \item [Psychological/social support] Therapy for all the patient's family may help. Training also helps patients get jobs, learn skills and manage their lives.
        \item [Hospitalization] Long-term stays in hospital used to be common, but are now rare. Some people may be held in hospital against their will.
        \item [Expectations] Most patients don't get much better. Most smoke or take drugs. Most don't lead healthy lifestyles and die earlier than normal.

        \item [Start] People who had been patients in psychiatric hospitals started forming groups in the 70's. Some groups were for self-help. Others were anti-psychiatry, opposed to psychiatry and the way people treat them. Some groups were a mixture of these ideas.
        \item [Government involvement] In the late '70s, government money was given to advocacy groups. 
        \item [Split] This money split the movement into `consumer' groups, which took medication willingly and got more money, and `survivor' groups, which rejected psychiatry and didn't get as much money. The `survivors' are against forcing patients to take medication.
