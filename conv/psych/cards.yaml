        \begin{description}
        \item [Medication] Drugs are used to control symptoms, but have serious side effects. They have a good effect in 40-50 percent of cases, and no effect in 20 percent.
        \item [Psychological/social support] Therapy for all the patient's family may help. Training also helps patients get jobs, learn skills and manage their lives.
        \item [Hospitalization] Long-term stays in hospital used to be common, but are now rare. Some people may be held in hospital against their will.
        \item [Expectations] Most patients don't get much better. Most smoke or take drugs. Most don't lead healthy lifestyles and die earlier than normal.

      B: You were mentally retarded and very fearful of people. Your family couldn't handle you. They had Sig admit you to Rockland in 1960 when you were 8. You made friends with Ralph. Both of you got out of Rockland in 1970. You hadn't seen Ralph in 40 years.
      C: You were a psychiatrist at Rockland. You told Jim it was difficult to treat the patients with respect and kindness, because of their behavior, which was not normal. But with new drugs, many of the patients were able to live outside. So you closed the hospital.
      D: Your family asked Sig to put you in Rockland when you were 8, the same age as Don. You were the opposite of Don. He was in a shell and never talked. You were very wild and angry. But you became friends. In 2010, Jim asked you to meet Don again and talk about Rockland.
