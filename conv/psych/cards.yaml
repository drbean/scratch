        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Medication] Drugs are used to control symptoms, but have serious side effects. They have a good effect in 40-50 percent of cases, and no effect in 20 percent.
        \item [Psychological/social support] Therapy for all the patient's family may help. Training also helps patients get jobs, learn skills and manage their lives.
        \item [Hospitalization] Long-term stays in hospital used to be common, but are now rare. Some people may be held in hospital against their will.
        \item [Expectations] Most patients don't get much better. Most smoke or take drugs. Most don't lead healthy lifestyles and die earlier than normal.

      B: You liked your Ethiopian-American classmate, Showaye. Her mother was crazy. She tried to hit you with an umbrella when she saw you close to her. Like Showaye, you were black. But you speak Black English. She speaks Standard American English.
      C: You were the spirit which possessed Saba. You killed her. You didn't want her to leave Ethiopia. You wanted her children to be Ethiopians, not Americans, so you locked them up and tried to prevent them from interacting with Americans.
      D: Doctors told you your mother, Saba had paranoid schizophrenia. She died because she refused to see a doctor when she was sick. She also didn't feed you. Your school used to give John and you a good, free lunch everyday, because Saba had no money. Your family often had nowhere to stay.
