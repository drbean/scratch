        \item [Paranoid] Delusions and hallucinations are present, but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and emotional "flatness" may be absent.
        \item [Disorganized] Thought disorder and emotional flatness are present together.
        \item [Catatonic] The patient may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and "waxy" flexibility.

        \begin{description}
        \item [Medication] Drugs are used to control symptoms, but have serious side effects. They have a good effect in 40-50 percent of cases, and no effect in 20 percent.
        \item [Psychological/social support] Therapy for all the patient's family may help. Training also helps patients get jobs, learn skills and manage their lives.
        \item [Hospitalization] Long-term stays in hospital used to be common, but are now rare. Some people may be held in hospital against their will.
        \item [Expectations] Most patients don't get much better. Most smoke or take drugs. Most don't lead healthy lifestyles and die earlier than normal.
