    John: At the time there was a lack for other resources for what a family could do when they had a family member who was not well.  Having no other choice, my parents had me committed. I was put into a small room, locked, bars on the door. The doctor told my parents that I was hopelessly insane, that I would never leave Bryce, that they should visit me less. At home they should speak of me less ..

    John: I'm not supposed to get a shock treatment today. Permission had been removed by my family. He looked at me and he said, Get up on the table. And I do remember a slam of the electricity through my head.

    John: In a word, I lied. I started studying television programs.

    John: I would just watch people, listen to how they interacted. I knew that to the degree that someone seemed normal, the doctors, the nurses, they were more interested in thinking of that person as someone who could leave Bryce Hospital.

    John: Thank you, Glenny.
