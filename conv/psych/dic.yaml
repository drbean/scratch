    John: At the time there was a lack for other resources for what a family could do when they had a family member who was not well.  Having no other choice, my parents had me committed. I was put into a small room, locked, bars on the door. The doctor told my parents that I was hopelessly insane, that I would never leave Bryce, that they should visit me less. At home they should speak of me less ..

    John: .. and at a point they should move on with their lives and leave me behind.

    Glenny: Do you remember anything that happened to you in the hospital?

    John: Yes. I began to be given a shock treatments. My older sister, Kay, visited and I spoke with great feeling about it and asked that she have them stop. Kay said that she would. And as the day went on, I spoke with the doctor. I said, Doctor ..

    John: I'm not supposed to get a shock treatment today. Permission had been removed by my family. He looked at me and he said, Get up on the table. And I do remember a slam of the electricity through my head.

    Some years after I looked at my psychiatric records, and Kay had removed family permission for them to give me shock treatments.

    Glenny: How did you get out?

    John: In a word, I lied. I started studying television programs.

    John: I would just watch people, listen to how they interacted. I knew that to the degree that someone seemed normal, the doctors, the nurses, they were more interested in thinking of that person as someone who could leave Bryce Hospital.

    Glenny: Watching how you have lived your life makes me think that it is possible to fight through things and to live. I think it sort of made me brave. Thank you, Dad.

    John: Thank you, Glenny.

    Showaye: She asked me where I wanted to eat, and my favorite meal was like Chef Boyardee ravioli. And I went to stick my finger in to like get the little gooey bits of ravioli from the inside of the can and I cut myself. She goes into the kitchen to get a rag to clean my cut off and she reaches around the wall with this little yellow bunny rabbit puppet. And she's like, hello, how are you? And I'm just laughing hysterically. I forgot I cut myself.

    Showaye: I loved it.

    Susan: Part of the challenge for you, though, was that you were homeless from a very young age.

    Showaye: Yeah, she was a paranoid schizophrenic. We would move around from place to place because she thought that people were trying to follow us, poison us, and kidnap me or my brother. She would drop me off to school and wait outside of the school. She was always outside, so I was like, literally able to look out the window and see my mother downstairs.

    Showaye: The kids would kind of like make fun of me, like, oh my gosh, is that your mom? Eventually she ended up locking me in my room and she would use like a combination lock on the outside.

    Susan: You know, you're not the kind of person who someone meets and goes, oh my God, what a life she had.

    Showaye: Yeah.

    Susan: 'Cause you told me that you still have anxieties about...

    Selassie: I have anxieties about other people, because I'm always wondering if I'm meeting someone are they wondering ..

    Showaye: .. if something's wrong. I've read so many articles about mental illness, because I feel like any point in time it's going to like fall out of the sky.  

    Susan: What do you think got you through?

    Showaye: My brother and my mother. I could have had it much worse.

    Susan: Um-hum.

    Showaye: You know, I could have had a parent that didn't care about me, so even though she went through what she went through, I still consider her one of the most fascinating people I'll ever meet.
