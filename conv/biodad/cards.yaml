  \begin{description}
  \item [Definition] Single parents are parents who care for one or more children without the assistance of the other parent in the home.
  \item [Background] The living and parenting arrangements of single parents are of many different types. Some live in households with family or other adults.
  \item [Statistics] In the US, around 12.9 million, or 9 percent of all, families are  headed by a single-parent, 80 percent of them by a female. An example is US President Obama's family.
  \item [Effects] Single parent families are more likely to be poor than other families, and on average single mothers have poorer health than other mothers. \\
  Single parenting results in a number of negative social, behavioral and emotional outcomes for children. However while the association is strong, the size of the effects and the actual numbers of children affected are not that big. Most children from single parent families do well. \\
  The factors which influence how children develop in single-parent families include the parent's age, education, and occupation; the family's income and support network of friends and extended family members.
