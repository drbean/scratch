      A: You are a young Anglo-American man, who has some new Mexican immigrants as neighbors. They don't speak much English, and you don't speak Spanish. So you have problems telling Pedro about Thanksgiving.  But you are interested in their interest in Thanksgiving.
      B: You immigrated with your kids to the US. You can speak English. Jose and Juan ask you to talk to Jack and ask him to explain Thanksgiving. Jack tells you about pumpkin pie, so you go out and buy some pumpkin pie. But it tastes horrible.
      C: There is no school for a few days for you and your brother Juan because of Thanksgiving. You are curious about this American holiday. Jack tells your dad about pumpkin pie. So your dad goes and buys some frozen pumpkin pie. But you can't cut it.
      D: You and your brother Jose have no school because of Thanksgiving. You think Thanksgiving is some saint's name. San (as in San Francisco) means saint, in Spanish. You look in a church missal for San-Giving, but can't find it.
