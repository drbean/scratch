      A: You had brain damage when you were young, so you can't speak and move your arms and legs very well. But you are very dedicated. You try very hard to work with your scoutmaster, Richard Coleman, and his wife, and help other scouts do the activities, like camping and learning skills like first aid, swimming and woodworking.
      B: You had a traffic accident when you were young and cannot walk. You feel sad. Your mother thought joining the boy scouts would help you live a better life. The mentally-disabled and physically-disabled Derek Connell is helpful
      C: Your husband Richard is a scoutmaster. He has been a scoutmaster for much of his life. You and he have two daughters, and although he loves them, having a scout troop is a substitute for having no sons.
      D: You and your wife, Claudia, have a scout troop. You didn't know what to do with the kids with special needs when you first started leading the troop, but gradually you forgot about their problems and started enjoying getting them to do what they could do. Your wife also started enjoying getting involved and helping you. Your Eagle Scout, Derek, is also helpful.

        \begin{normalsize}Job of pest controller\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Pest control workers remove unwanted creatures like roaches, rats, ants and fleas. They rely on their knowledge of pests and use many types of chemicals, traps, and other equipment. They may even cut or drill into buildings. The final choice of action may be left to the consumer.
        \item [Actions] Pest controllers use general-use insecticides and restricted-use pesticides that the government only allows to professionals. They also use `integrated pest management' to try to prevent pests coming back.
        \item [Integrated pest management] The use of a number of different techniques, like baits, traps, and physical barriers together with chemicals is popular, because pesticides harm the environment and the pests soon return.
        \item [Training] The government requires pest controllers to have training. A person with a high school diploma can apply to do certification tests. Entry-level training usually requires 10 hours in the classroom and 60 hours on the job. But they must continue to attend training sessions throughout their careers. Employers usually also want people who are good communicators and who can do physically hard work, eg sliding into narrow crawlspaces in winter.
        \item [Employment] There are more jobs in the South and in large cities. There will continue to be many jobs open for pestcontrollers, because many people don't like the work. The average earnings was \$13/hour in 2006.

        \begin{normalsize}Andy Linares' story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Start] In the Storycorps soundfile, Linares suggests he started work as a pest controller after he couldn't find a job using his graduate degree in political science. In fact, he started working for his uncle's pest control company, Matador, when he was in high school. Then it was simply a way to make money.
        \item [Dream] While in graduate school, he worked at the United Nations organizing meetings, but the job led nowhere, although his French became very good. He felt like he had hit a brick wall at the UN, so he left to find a job in an international institution or company. But he was unsuccessful.
        \item [Company owner] Finally, he bought his uncle's pest control business from him when he retired, but he wasn't happy.
        \item [Changes] It's not clear why he finally came to be happy with his job. Anyway, after taking over his uncle's pest control company, he made changes. He started selling pesticides to smaller companies that needed supplies. He also ran training programs for people who wanted to get pest control licenses. Now, he also runs exhibitions where pest control companies come and show what they are doing.
        \item [Satisfaction] He says he is generous with his knowledge, and it's satisfying to know he's helped people.

        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The need for women] World War II started in the US in 1941. Women were brought into war work from 1942. Men were going to war and many industries were switching to war production. At first, there was lots of reluctance on the parts of managers, husbands, male workers, and many women, too.
        \item [War effort] A shipyard in California, like the one Dorothy Kelley was working at, where 25\% of the workers were women, produced 747 ships in 5 years. One time, they produced a ship in 5 days. Usually, it took them 2 weeks.
        \item [Groups of women workers] Some women were already working, for example in laundries, like Dorothy Kelley Others had worked before but had lost their jobs. The third group was first-time workers. Many were married, white and middle-class and had to be encouraged to stop being housewives and go out to work.
        \item [Women's Liberation] It is not clear whether women's war work affected the position of women after the war. Did their working sow the seeds of the second wave of feminism, ie Women's Liberation?
        \item [Women's voices] "My mother warned, 'You will never want to go back to being a housewife.' She was right. At Boeing I found a freedom and an independence that I had never known." Inez Sauer, Boeing clerk.\\
        "You came out to California, put on your pants, and took your lunch pail to a man's job. This was the beginning of women's feeling that they could do something more." Sybil Lewis, Lockheed riveter.

        \item [Supporting the family] Although her husband regularly sent her money after the divorce, she needed to also go to work. sometimes at two jobs, to support her children. From 1943 until World War II ended in 1945, she was a welder on the Liberty Ships in the South Portland shipyard.  After the war, she worked days at Portland's Montgomery Ward department store and evenings as a paper sorter in the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook, a job she held until her retirement in 1957. 
        \item [Re-marriage] She was married to Forrest Hamblen, 1948-1952. She then married Roger Meserve in 1953 and that marriage continued until his death in 1985.
        \item [Interests] Among other things, she wrote poetry. Her interest in reading and writing was passed on to her children. She continued reading until her death in 2002, despite eyesight problems.
        \item [Children] John became a university biology professor. Joyce Butler studied English in college but after getting married became a writer about the history of Maine, the area where she and her mother live. And Robert Eaton writes novels.

      B: You are the brother of Joyce. Like her, you are a writer. She writes about the history of Maine, where your family comes from. You write novels. You don't live in your hometown. You live in Germany, the country which your country was fighting in World War Two.
      C: Before the war, you were a housewife. After the divorce, you worked in a laundry, then in a department store, then in a shipyard, which was hard work, but paid well. Your boss was Ray. After the war, you went back to the department store, but you also had to work at night in a paper mill to make enough money.
      D: You gave Dorothy a job during the war at the shipyard. You weren't too sure if employing her was a good idea, because it was hard work, even for a man.

        \begin{normalsize}Hair dressers--the job in the US\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Licenses/Training] All hair dressers need to be licensed in the US. This usually requires a high school diploma, and also graduation from a hair dressing school. After graduation, there is a government exam that may include a practical test. Full-time programs usually last 9 months, but most professionals take advanced classes to keep up with new trends. Licenses are issued by state governments. so it is difficult for hair dressers to move to work in another state.
        \item [Employment] About half of all hairdressers are self-employed, having their own salon, or renting a chair from a salon's owner. Nearly every town in the US has a barber shop or beauty salon, but most hair dressers are concentrated in the cities. Many full-time barbers work 40 hours per week, but longer hours (often in the evening) are common. Many determine their own hours and about 30\%  are part-time.
        \item [Money] The average cost of a haircut in the US is \$21-45, but you can also pay \$800. The average hourly wage of hairdressers is \$11. Wages vary greatly depending on the location of the hair salon, and your ability to attract and hold customers.
        \item [The future] The number of jobs for hair dressers is expected to increase faster than jobs for other people until 2018. Opportunities for beginners should be good, but competition for top-paying jobs will be strong.

        \begin{normalsize}Life in Drexel\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The place] Drexel is in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the south-east of the United States. People there used to be called `hillbillies.' Most Americans looked down on them, because they were poor and rough. However, people liked their music, and, when recorded from the mid-1920s, it contributed to the creation of `country music.'
        \item [Lawrence Anthony] Anthony, who died in December, 2009, was born about the time that the music started becoming popular, 80 years ago. Besides being a barber, Anthony also liked to play traditional styles of country music on guitar. Amateur guitarists from the area gathered in the back of his barber shop on Saturdays, to play with him. Those `picking sessions' may or may not be continuing. There's not much happening in Drexel now.
        \item [Drexel Furniture Company] The company, started in 1903, was one of a number of furniture makers in the Piedmont area. The supply of wood and cheap labor there was good, But, the quality of their furniture was poor. Gradually, however, Drexel grew to become the third biggest furniture company in the US, making many different styles of medium-priced furniture. But since the 1990's, with the economic slow-down in the US, Drexel's factories have closed one after the other, and the furniture is now made outside the US.
        \end{description}

        - question: Most barbers work in small towns like Anthony and Shirley.
          answer: False
        - question: Anthony may be continuing to play in the barbershop.
          answer: False
        - question: Popular barbers make more money than unpopular barbers.
          answer: True

        \begin{normalsize}Dr Bean's father's career\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Dr Bean's father, Bill, started working soon after World War 2 as a chemical engineer. He stayed with his company, a paint manufacturer, for 30 years, and ended up as the plant manager.
        \item [Ending] He left the company because there was no opportunity for advancement and spent the last 10 years of his career as the manager of a sewerage treatment plant.
        \item [Interests] This description of his career gives no indication of his real interests, which were building and sailing boats. When he was younger, he had been interested in hiking and a number of other recreations, but after getting married and building a house for the family (his father had been a builder), sailing and building boats became his prime interest. In the evenings after work, he would work on the boats. He lived for the weekend. He got up earlier on the weekend than he did during the week to go sailing in summer and build boats in the winter.
        \item [Children] Dr Bean's mother says his three sons are all the opposite to him. They are all `workaholics,' and have no interests outside their work. One is a theater director and the other is a graphic (book) designer. However, perhaps they selected careers where they did not have to divide their lives into the `work' and `play' sections the way their father had to.

        \begin{normalsize}Dr Bean's career\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Before] Like Andy Linares, who didn't intend to become a pest controller, Dr Bean didn't intend to be an English teacher. In fact, he didn't see himself as having a regular career. It was only 15 years after dropping out from graduate school, that he got a job he stayed in for more than a year. when he started working as an editor at The Korea Times, It was the experience of learning Japanese in Japan that made English teaching very interesting for him.
        \item [Starting] Clearly, the reason he started working regularly was to support his wife, who he had met in Japan. He used to joke about English teaching, `I'm only in it for the money.' But clearly he enjoyed teaching too.
        \item [Life outside work] Although Dr Bean may appear to be a `workaholic,' he does have interests outside teaching English. For him, computer programming is relaxing. Only incidentally does it help him in his classes. He finds teaching stressful. He can't get the students to do what he wants them to do. But he can get the computer to do what he wants it to do. He enjoys that.
        \item [Career] Dr Bean is not sure if he has a `career.' He has a job. He has work. He is happy doing what he is doing, But he doesn't want recognition for his work, and he doesn't want a position in society. He is glad that he can get paid for doing what he likes to do.
