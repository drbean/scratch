    "00:41 My brother Stanley and I came home from school.
    00:45 And Mom told us that our aunt wanted to talk to us. 
    00:50 So we went out and got in the old pick up and drove over there. 
    00:55 And my aunt started telling us that Mom had this disease that my aunt Pearl had had and old Fred and so forth down the line. 
    01:06 That's the first day I heard the word, Alzheimers. 
    01:10 When we got back to the farm it was dark. 
    01:13 And Mom and Dad were in a fight. 
    01:15 Dad had gotten home from work and wanted to know where we were at. 
    01:18 And she had forgotten where we had gone. 
    01:21 They were yelling and screaming at each other. 
    01:23 And it was a horrible night for all of us. 
    01:26 I was the one that became the care person for my mother at that time. 
    01:30 I was thirteen. 
    01:32 I got to high school. 
    01:34 I was in my senior year. 
    01:36 And by this time, Mom was sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket wrapped around her, and all the blinds pulled down. 
    01:44 That year, she asked me if I could help her die and I told her I couldn't. 
    01:50 And after that, she started trying to run away. 
    01:52 Any chance that she thought she could sneak out of the house she would leave. 
    01:57 And I'd have to go find her. "

    "02:01 I was diagnosed in 2004 with Alzheimers. 
    02:06 I was 50. 
    02:07 A friend of mine sent me an email right after my diagnosis. 
    02:11 She said, This is terrible. 
    02:13 This isn't fair. 
    02:14 And this is a horrible thing. 
    02:16 And I wrote back to her and I said, Well, it's not that bad. 
    02:20 It's not like you're in pain all the time. 
    02:24 But, um, it takes a toll on your family, because I know that when they see my failing they get really sad and they don't like to see that. 
    02:35 I wish they would try to understand that I may be a little different. 
    02:41 There's a time there, where, uh, I will forget everybody's name. 
    02:46 But inside, I'm still there. 
    02:50 I'm still me. 
    02:52 Inside, I'm thinking how much fun I'm having with them. 
    02:55 And I, as much as possible, would like to be treated as I have been treated before."

    "Charles Jackson didn't really have a happy family life after his mother, Lotte got Alzheimer's disease. At first Jack, his father, and Lotte, argued a lot. Before he realized Lotte had Alzheimer's, Jack thought Lotte was being careless and stupid. This made him very angry with her. When Jack started shouting at Lotte, Lotte would started shouting back at him. Gradually Jack realized that Lotte's behavior wasn't under her control. But this didn't make him any happier. He was very unhappy that his wife was slowly losing her mind. All this made Charles, his brother, and especially his mother, unhappy too.

    Charles father and his brother gradually started spending as little time at home as they could. Charles' father told him it was his job to look after his mother and before he went to school in the morning and after he came home from school, he had to feed her and help her go to the bathroom.

    When he got home in the afternoon, he would always find Lotte sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket around her and the blinds pulled down. She was so unhappy that she asked Charles to help her die. Charles couldn't agree to do that.

    Later she became unable to walk. But before that she started trying to run away. She would leave the house and just walk away from the house with no idea of where she was going or what she was looking for. Charles used to lock the door to prevent her leaving, but she would try to jump out the window, or she would leave the house when Jack wasn't looking."

    "When Charles turned 50, he started having problems with memory at work and home. He couldn't remember how to get to work, and he couldn't remember if he had eaten breakfast or not. Other people were the first to notice. His wife, Carol didn't know much about Alzheimer's but she knew that Charles' mother had had Alzheimer's.

    She asked him to get diagnosed. When the doctors told him he had Alzheimer's, he already knew was the condition was like, as a result of his experience with his mother. He knew what was going to happen. He would gradually forget everything and stop doing things and would just sit in a chair all day. That was helpful to him. He didn't feel as worried as he might have about what was going to happen to him.

    A friend, Brenda sent him an email after she found out. She thought the idea of losing your mind was horrible, and felt disturbed that Charles was going to turn into this kind of person. He said he was less worried, and he asked her not to stop being a friend.

    He thought that the condition itself was not as bad as the treatment that people with Alzheimer's get from their family and friends. He remembered his father's treatment of his mother, and hoped that his wife and his children would not treat him the same way as that. He wanted them to treat him the same way as they always had. He wanted them to love him and to understand that even though he might act differently, he was still the same person inside and he was still having fun with them."

    "Sarafino: I understand your mom had breast cancer. What was that like?
    Dana: It was very scary. She'd been very sick. And they took her to a hospital. And a physician came out to talk to us when we got there. And told us that she had cancer and that they didn't expect her to survive. And I remember thinking that there was a way that they could have told us that was softer.
    Sarafino: Is that why you wanted to become a cancer nurse?
    Dana: You know, I think so. I can't imagine doing anything else.
    Sarafino: How does it feel to you telling someone they're going to die.
    Dana: Oh, it's horrible. A lot of times when you get to that point, they know it. And you know it. Because they don't feel good. And they know what we're doing to them is not making them better. So a lot of times when we have that talk with them, they've kind of prepared for it.
    Sarafino: Are you friends with some patients?
    Dana: Mmh-hmm. They all teach you something. They've taught me to celebrate the smallest things in life, like hair growing back. I learn about fear. And I learn about hope, and I really learn what love is. Love is that deep, intense feeling for another person's soul. And that it's okay to let that person go. We all don't know how long we're going to be on this planet. And that's why it's important to love each other and to, you know, cherish a human being.
    Sarafino: I really think God wanted you to be what you are, because you're awesome at it. You make patients smile. You walk in there, and they're all like, Dana. Oh, my gosh, she's here. To me, you are maybe the angels on earth. You come down and try your best to heal people. You are my hero.
    Dana: Thank you."

    Richard: Derek, I joined your troop in 1987. I had two daughters, so in a way this was a 'night out with the boys.'
    Claudia: I wanted to be part of the group, too. And I became an assistant scoutmaster to Troop 409.
    Richard: And Derek, why did you want to become a boy scout?
    Derek: Because I saw it in the World Book. I've been doing scouting for almost twenty-six years. And it's hard to believe that our troop's lasted that long.
    Richard: Since we're registered as a special needs group, we have no age limit. That's why Derek, when he was about 34, ....

    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: Why did you stay in the boy scouts all these years?
    Derek: Because everybody needs my help. Because some of 'em are a little slow, Some of 'em can't read and write.
    Richard: Now these guys all work together. You remember Randy? He's on his wheelchair?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: We took him to summer camp with us. And since we're in the Panhandle of Florida, there's a lot of soft sand. And try and maneuver a wheelchair around is kind of hard.

    And this is how resourceful these scouts are. They came up with an idea that if they harnessed themselves to the wheelchair. Randy could sit back there and yell 'Mush.'
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: It was like a dog sled. And they would drag him around camp like this.
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: So, we're the can-do troop. I try not to pay attention to what their problems are. 'Cause when I've got 'em. they're all scouts.
    Derek: The thing is, if we can't do something right, they don't get mad about it. Some people, you know, if you can't do it right, phfft, that's it.

    Richard: How would you describe Derek?
    Claudia: Dedicated.
    Richard: And you're our troop historian, aren't you?
    Derek: Yeh. Mmh-hmm.
    Claudia: I'd just like to, uh, thank Derek for all the help and all the encouragement you give the new scouts in the troop, Derek.
    Derek: You're welcome.
    Claudia: And I told your mom, that you carried the spirit of Troop 409 in your heart. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
    Derek: Thank you.

    Mother: When Bridget was a little less than a year old we knew that she had a hearing problem. So, what did that do to your life?

    Son: Well, on one hand, you get to meet so many other hearing-impaired people that you would have never known if your sister wasn't deaf. But people will make fun of her in school and she'll come home and she's all upset about it. When kids are making fun of her I usually just tell her ..

    Son: Yeah. Like, she's special.

    Mother: Yeah. So, I know you probably don't remember this, but when you were four, you went and sat on Santa's lap and Santa asked you what you wanted.

    Son: Thank you. And I think that you parent her really well. You don't treat her like she's not there because she's deaf. You listen to her 'cause she's your kid, still, no matter what.

    Mother: Right. Are you sure you're only ten?

    Son: What? Yeah.
