    "00:38 A group gathered around in chairs.
    00:42 And they were all wearing their nice Christmas clothing, 
    00:43 and I thought, Well, how nice, you know, they have no idea that I'm going to bore them to sleep with my tuning. 
    00:49 And I’m kind of working along happily and I’m smiling at people. 
    00:54 And a few of them were looking at me like, What in the world is he doing? 
    00:58 One lady was just glaring at me. 
    01:01 Another lady was giving me sympathetic looks (Her name turned out to be Rose). 
    01:06 And then the activity director comes in and says:
    01:09 OK, everybody, Miss Jennifer was here and she saw that the piano man was tuning the piano, 
    01:14 so she’ll be back in January. 
    01:18 I didn’t realize they had a concert scheduled that day. "

    01:30 The angry lady barked at me and said, you know: \"Haven't you ever heard if isn't broke, don't fix it?\" 
    01:37 And she stormed off. 
    01:38 I had scooted over on my seat out of the view of Rose because she looked so hurt.
    01:44 And suddenly, she touched my arm, and it startled me. 
    01:50 And I looked. And she was very close to me.
    01:54 And she told me very sincerely,
    01:57 I've been sitting here the whole time and 
    02:00 I've been watching what you do and I can tell that you're the kind of person 
    02:06 who would never walk away from this piano until everything was just so. 
    02:09 That was a moment where someone did just the right thing, 
    02:14 just out of the blue.
    02:17 And it did mean something to me."

    Debra: How did you get the job as doorman at the Plaza Hotel.
    Ed: Well, my father was a garage manager at the Plaza for thirty years.
    And he was friends with all the doormen.
    And when I graduated from high school, he said,
    There's a nice job for you over there.
    Just go over and talk to somebody.
    One of the doormen was sick and they put the hat and coat on me, which fit very well.
    And they put me on the door right away.
    And I got outside and started working.
    That was my first job.
    And then, uh, it was great.

    And he says, Here's a hundred and fifty dollars. Merry Christmas.
    And he says, By the way, who was the one who gave you a hundred?
    And I says, Well, that was you last year.
    Debra: Now, I got to know you because I walk to work every morning, and I cut by the Plaza, and you made my day. \"Good morning, young lady.\" \"Beautiful day.\"

    I had a guest come in one morning, six-thirty in the morning.
    And he had to go to a very important meeting.
    And he asked me where he could get his shoes shined.
    And I says, It don't open till eight o'clock. Our barber shop.
    So I said, I tell you what. Give me the shoes and you come back in a half an hour...

    Matter of fact, he comes back to the Plaza all the time.

    You know, my father told me years ago,
    He said, Be such a man, and live such a life, that if, everybody lived a life like yours, this would be God's paradise.
    And I go by that.

    "00:41 My brother Stanley and I came home from school.
    00:45 And Mom told us that our aunt wanted to talk to us. 
    00:50 So we went out and got in the old pick up and drove over there. 
    00:55 And my aunt started telling us that Mom had this disease that my aunt Pearl had had and old Fred and so forth down the line. 
    01:06 That's the first day I heard the word, Alzheimers. 
    01:10 When we got back to the farm it was dark.

    01:15 Dad had gotten home from work and wanted to know where we were at. 
    01:18 And she had forgotten where we had gone.

    "Ed Trinka worked as a doorman at the Plaza Hotel, a very old and very famous hotel in New York. His job was to greet guests as they came into the hotel, help them get out of their cars, and help them with their bags. This was very simple to do.

    But he also had to do something which was more difficult to do. That was the job of making guests feel important and happy about staying at the Plaza. Ed did a very good job of this, because he was a happy and friendly person.

    He didn't do this because the boss, Shane, said he had to. He did it because he liked people. One time, a guest wanted his shoes shined very early in the morning, before the shoe shine stand was open, so he shone the shoes himself, not because the boss said he had to, but because Ed just wanted to help.

    He just made people around him feel happy, even when they weren't very happy before seeing him. Someone like Jackie Gleason was not a happy person, even though he made other people laugh. He used to make Jackie Gleason feel happy, so Gleason gave him very big tips. And, he was friendly even with people passing in the street like Debra Goodman."

    "Ed Trinka has now stopped working at the Plaza. He is sixty-five. He worked there for forty-six years. His father also worked at the Plaza Hotel and he got Ed the job as doorman. The employees made a lot of the decisions about who could work at the hotel. If your relatives worked at the hotel, it was easier to get a job there.

    Managers found it very difficult to control the doormen and other staff at the hotel. The staff didn't listen to the managers. Shane, the general manager told Ed to treat everyone like a VIP, but Ed didn't really listen to Shane. He told Shane I already do treat everyone like a VIP.

    Fortunately, Ed was very popular with the guests at the Plaza, a very expensive and famous old hotel. All the guests had lots of money. And many of them were famous and important. They really were VIPs.

    Ed stopped working for the Plaza for a while because he didn't like Shane telling him what to do. But when Shane asked him to come back to the Plaza Hotel, he returned. Ed said he never had a bad day working at the hotel, but that may not really be true. One thing that made Ed unhappy was the death of his wife, who was working at the hotel too. Now he is looking for a new wife."

    "Charles Jackson didn't really have a happy family life after his mother, Lotte got Alzheimer's disease. At first Jack, his father, and Lotte, argued a lot. Before he realized Lotte had Alzheimer's, Jack thought Lotte was being careless and stupid. This made him very angry with her. When Jack started shouting at Lotte, Lotte would started shouting back at him. Gradually Jack realized that Lotte's behavior wasn't under her control. But this didn't make him any happier. He was very unhappy that his wife was slowly losing her mind. All this made Charles, his brother, and especially his mother, unhappy too.

    Charles father and his brother gradually started spending as little time at home as they could. Charles' father told him it was his job to look after his mother and before he went to school in the morning and after he came home from school, he had to feed her and help her go to the bathroom.

    When he got home in the afternoon, he would always find Lotte sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket around her and the blinds pulled down. She was so unhappy that she asked Charles to help her die. Charles couldn't agree to do that.

    Later she became unable to walk. But before that she started trying to run away. She would leave the house and just walk away from the house with no idea of where she was going or what she was looking for. Charles used to lock the door to prevent her leaving, but she would try to jump out the window, or she would leave the house when Jack wasn't looking."

    "When Charles turned 50, he started having problems with memory at work and home. He couldn't remember how to get to work, and he couldn't remember if he had eaten breakfast or not. Other people were the first to notice. His wife, Carol didn't know much about Alzheimer's but she knew that Charles' mother had had Alzheimer's.

    She asked him to get diagnosed. When the doctors told him he had Alzheimer's, he already knew was the condition was like, as a result of his experience with his mother. He knew what was going to happen. He would gradually forget everything and stop doing things and would just sit in a chair all day. That was helpful to him. He didn't feel as worried as he might have about what was going to happen to him.

    A friend, Brenda sent him an email after she found out. She thought the idea of losing your mind was horrible, and felt disturbed that Charles was going to turn into this kind of person. He said he was less worried, and he asked her not to stop being a friend.

    He thought that the condition itself was not as bad as the treatment that people with Alzheimer's get from their family and friends. He remembered his father's treatment of his mother, and hoped that his wife and his children would not treat him the same way as that. He wanted them to treat him the same way as they always had. He wanted them to love him and to understand that even though he might act differently, he was still the same person inside and he was still having fun with them."

    "Sarafino: I understand your mom had breast cancer. What was that like?
    Dana: It was very scary. She'd been very sick. And they took her to a hospital. And a physician came out to talk to us when we got there. And told us that she had cancer and that they didn't expect her to survive. And I remember thinking that there was a way that they could have told us that was softer.
    Sarafino: Is that why you wanted to become a cancer nurse?
    Dana: You know, I think so. I can't imagine doing anything else.
    Sarafino: How does it feel to you telling someone they're going to die.
    Dana: Oh, it's horrible. A lot of times when you get to that point, they know it. And you know it. Because they don't feel good. And they know what we're doing to them is not making them better. So a lot of times when we have that talk with them, they've kind of prepared for it.
    Sarafino: Are you friends with some patients?
    Dana: Mmh-hmm. They all teach you something. They've taught me to celebrate the smallest things in life, like hair growing back. I learn about fear. And I learn about hope, and I really learn what love is. Love is that deep, intense feeling for another person's soul. And that it's okay to let that person go. We all don't know how long we're going to be on this planet. And that's why it's important to love each other and to, you know, cherish a human being.
    Sarafino: I really think God wanted you to be what you are, because you're awesome at it. You make patients smile. You walk in there, and they're all like, Dana. Oh, my gosh, she's here. To me, you are maybe the angels on earth. You come down and try your best to heal people. You are my hero.

    Claudia: I wanted to be part of the group, too. And I became an assistant scoutmaster to Troop 409.
    Richard: And Derek, why did you want to become a boy scout?
    Derek: Because I saw it in the World Book. I've been doing scouting for almost twenty-six years. And it's hard to believe that our troop's lasted that long.

    Richard: Now these guys all work together. You remember Randy? He's on his wheelchair?

    Richard: We took him to summer camp with us. And since we're in the Panhandle of Florida, there's a lot of soft sand. And try and maneuver a wheelchair around is kind of hard.

    Adam: Well, I was in my final year of university, and I wasn't in a serious relationship with anyone. It was kind of a fluke. You know they say it only takes once. And it turned out to be true. And it was probably the loneliest time of my entire life. When I was in the hospital, I was there for hours by myself. And then they took you away, and they wouldn't allow me to see you. But one of the nurses took pity on me and brought you in to my room in the middle of the night one night so that I could count fingers and toes.

    Adam: But then the other, uhm, practice was that in the case of adoption, I had to actually carry you out of the hospital and hand you to the doctor, physically. That was supposed to be an indication of my willingness to give up the child. And, that was hard.
    Dimasi: I want you to know that I never was angry. I never resented your decision. I've never had reason to. I knew that I was adopted, and my parents always made it a positive part of my life, that they picked me, that they really wanted me. And I just remember your being a question mark.

    "Shepard: I woke up the morning after I got to Glasgow and I decided to just go to the university to look around, see what I thought. I had the address written down for my biological father and I went there.

    I looked down the hallway and I saw a sign with his name. Finally, I just said this is probably the only chance in my life I will ever have to do this.

    Walked up to the door and knocked. He looked at me with a look that was not quite hostile, but impatient. I said, Do you have a minute? He said, Sure. And I said, Do you remember living in Connecticut 20 years ago. And he got this kind of odd smile on his face and said, Yes, I remember it.

    I said, Well, do you remember a relationship with a woman named Eloise, that you had? And he says, Yes, yes I do.

    And I says, Well, uhm, I'm the result of that relationship, And he says, Aaaaaah.

    Walks over towards me, and I have this panic that he's going to touch me. But he doesn't. He walks past me and he closes the door and walks back and sits down at the table where I'm seated, and says, So, you're here.

    And I said, Yeh. And I told him that I had three questions that I wanted to ask him. He said, Sure. And I said, First, I want to know if there is any history of diseases or things that I needed to be aware of, genetically, just to get that baseline out of the way. And, he said, No, not that I know of.

    And then I asked him if he would be willing to just explain a little the circumstances surrounding my birth, and how it came to be that I was born and he left. And for the first time and only time over the course of our fifteen-minute conversation, the grin left his face. And eventually, he said, Well, I think that at that point, Eloise was ready to have a child. And I said, And you were't. And he laughed, and said, No. Never was, never have been, He didn't really offer me anything more.

    Ryan: Did you ask your third question?

    Shepard: Yeh, I looked at him for a minute, and then I asked my third question, May I take a picture of you? I had a little disposable camera, took a picture of him, and, um, that was that.

    It ended with me, saying, Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. And I said, Goodbye, and he turned to walk back towards his computer, and he says, Goodbye for now.

    I don't know if I'll ever contact him, if I will ever want him to be a part of my life in any way. But for now, I don't.

    And, so, I walked back through this park in Glasgow back towards this place where I was staying and I felt that I had made a peace with a part of myself that I never expected, that I never even thought possible."

    PJ: Well, you know that my mom died when I was seven.
    Sam: Yes.
    PJ: And you know that I was on my own when I was sixteen. So what I did and what you get to do are going to be two different things, because ..
    Sam: Right, I'll always have somebody looking up for me. And, that's you, Dad, and ..
    PJ: That's right.
    Sam: And pretty much everybody else in our family.
    PJ: So, I was 18 years old and, um, I had a fake ID, and I was at this bar.
    Sam: You had a fake ID.
    PJ: Mmm-mmh. Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm telling you this. And, um, I was sitting at this barstool and your dad sat down. And I said to your dad, I said,  There's somebody sitting there. And he says, I don't care. I just have to meet you. And, he made me laugh, and that's what I needed right then. That's why I needed to laugh a little.

    We talked for about four hours, and then he walked me out to my car, but he never asked me for my phone number. And I got home that night, and I was writing in my diary, Very good-looking, but insecure.

    The next day, I was on my couch watching some afternoon TV, folding laundry, and I had told dad what apartment complex I lived in, but I didn't tell him what apartment or where I lived. So he drove in to the apartment complex and just laid his hand on the horn.
    Sam: (Laughs)
    PJ: And he just was driving through the complex. (Laughs). And I went out on my balcony, and I saw him, and I said, Oh my God, that's that guy from the bar last night, and he was like, Oh, hi, there you are, I've been looking for you! And that's the way he found me.

    Sam: What was the best times, the worst times in marriage? And did you ever think of getting divorced?
    PJ: You know, over the years, I have thought about getting divorced. Me and your dad were separated once for two years, but we got back together. And we never did get divorced. We came close a couple of times during that time. Umm.
    Sam: I remember like, you were like yelling. And you said, You want me to leave with the children? I was like in my bed, and I just heard that.
    PJ: I'm sorry you had to hear that, sweetie. Marriage isn't always pretty. I think sometimes we act like little children, and we need to be more mature about it, because it's a privilege to be married to somebody, and you need not to disrespect it like that. Like sometimes we get angry and we do. But we've been together for twenty-three years now. And I think your dad's taught me the meaning of love. Love is as much a feeling as it is an action.
    Sam: Right.
    PJ: You see what I'm saying.
    Sam: I see what you're saying.
    PJ: To love somebody is not just how you feel about them, but what you do, also."

   Stephanie: And you made me go back to school the next day and give him back the locket.
   Theresa: Okay, I was taught from my mom, do not accept presents from strangers, because if you accept presents from them, you have to repay them; it's a debt you have to carry to your grave. So things like that, I'd go back and be a little more understanding. I might ask to go swap it out for something cheaper.
   Most of your friends are Vietnamese too, right? And, um, I don't know if you ever compare, if your mommy is tougher than mine?
   Stephanie: I don't even know where to start with that. Oh, when you're 12 and your whole world revolves around who got to sleep over at whoever's house, it's not fun to say, 'Oh no, I can't do that.' 
   Theresa: I know, a lot of times I am living in this country trying to acculturate — but at the same time, I want to preserve the Asian culture. I want to keep the family together, And sometimes when I look back I ... I do realize that I was a little bit too tough.

    Smith: Welcome, come on in, if you got the rent money, you can stay. If you ain't, beat it! This is an eat it and beat it hotel.  Normally, people come in, they stay for a day or two and get out. But for some reason or another, people come here and they like to stay -- for a year, for two years. In other words they like to give you aggravations. If you like aggravations come to the Sunshine Hotel -- it's a lovely place.

    Smith: You checking out?

    Tenant: Yeah, I didn't like the fleas in the bed.

    Smith: Fleas?

    Smith: Yeah, I had fleas. I scratched all night, the whole time I was here. Yeah, roaches all over the wall.

    Tenant: You want to see ID of any kind?

    Smith: No, I believe you. This is the kind of hotel where everybody gives an AKA anyway.

    You're welcome to a room -- for a very nominal fee.

    Okay, here you are my friend, you're all set.

    Fogelman: Thanks a lot buddy.

    Smith: Okay, you can square yourself away, this that and the other.

    This is the last of the last.

    Welcome to the Sunshine Hotel.

    Smith: Good. You made the landlord a happy man.

    This hotel in 1998 probably looks the same as it did in 1928.  Like almost all of the flops, the lobby is on the second floor, up a narrow flight of steps. It's just a large room with wood floors and a couple of chairs. I sit in a cage at the front, running the joint.

                                (Phone rings.)

    There's only one telephone for the entire hotel, which keeps me pretty busy.

    Sunshine give me a ten-four. (Shouting) Hey Eddie, Eddie do me a favor! See if you can get Earl Simpson. Tell Earl it's his mother.

    Tenant: Can I have some toilet tissue?

    Smith: 35 cents a slice, I'll put it on your tab. You want paper too?  Okay.

    Past the lobby, you'll find the living quarters for the 125 residents of this hotel. The Sunshine is one of the last places in the country where people live in cubicles. Maybe it's a little hard to imagine for those of you living in more affluent circumstances. Picture a long hallway, with a series of doors on either side. These are the cubicles. Four by six, no windows. The cubicle walls are only seven feet high, so there's chicken wire along the top to keep guys from climbing over into the next room.

I was supposed to speak to the branch. You always had to speak to the units. So I wanted to take a bath. And there was a tin tub. It was about two feet deep. And large enough to wash clothing in. That's what the tub was intended for. Anyway, I decided that I wanted to sit down. And get the water over me, because I was hot and dusty. But then I couldn't push myself up from the tub.

     Everybody got something in their life that they're good at. This is what I do good--I eat. I was always a bigger eater than most people in my family and about five years ago there was an ad in the paper for a matzo ball contest. I went down to the contest. I broke a record; I ate ten matzo balls, half-pounders the size of baseballs, in two minutes, fifty seconds. No one ever ate more than ten. And I went on to the finals and I won. And Mayor Giuliani gave me the trophy, and the announcer said, `Let's hear it for Don Lerman ...

And the only place I could weigh would be to go to old Baptist Hospital and then weigh on those freight scales. And I didn't know how to work the scales. I always had to get somebody help, and then they go and rush to tell everybody come and look here.

    It wasn't a place, really, where people could find refuge. I mean, as the days went on, the water continued to rise, so you couldn't go back out. And the people never stopped coming in.

    There was a point where we were trying to get the evacuation going. And the one image that haunts me to this day, there was a woman that broke through the crowd and she had a little boy in her arms ..

    As I turned and told them to hold hands, that we was going to have to get into the water, the roof came down on all of us and my lungs started filling up with water.

    The flight attendants were picking up the dishes and one member of the flight crew came back to look out the window at the wings. But he was calm, he was talking to people. So there was confidence that this was just a hitch; that we were going to be fine.

    I was about a senior in high school. And, uh, a friend took me up for an airplane ride. And that was just amazing to me. The, the freedom of flight. And living in Kansas, there's so much aviation history. And I just gravitated towards that.

    I've, I've worked in the aviation industry for many many years. But I, I do remember taking that first flight and I remember, uh, thinking, Yeah, this is going to be my path. As a matter of fact, I was married on an airplane.

    John and I, my current husband, we were both into aviation when we met ...

    ... and we were avidly following the progress of a airliner in Kansas City that was being restored by a group of ex-TWA mechanics and friends. And this was a Lockheed Constellation.
    It was a very popular aircraft that flew in the late fifties up until probably the mid-sixties. And it happened to be the plane that my parents immigrated on. So it had a lot of meaning. And, uh, John and I each brought a beautiful daughter into the marriage. So they were dressed like stewardesses from the fifties. And they carried red TWA roses. And I had on a vintage dress from the time.

    We were very limited on the amount of people we could have. So it was pretty much just my parents. And it was, uh, quite interesting for my parents to be back on the plane after all these years, to see the plane. It wasn't the same plane, the same model aircraft, that they came over on.

    It was just a fascinating experience. The gentleman that married us was a pilot. The people affiliated with the TWA Connie were very, very accommodating. And they'd never had a wedding on the plane before. 
    And we couldn't afford the plane in flight, so it was stationary.

    So it was quite interesting walking off of the airplane, coming down the stairs and receiving applause from thousands of people from Kansas City that I, I had no idea who they were, but it was kind of nice that they were at our wedding.

    Robbie: Most of the guests came from New York, New Jersey. At the end of their six weeks, Mother would go to court with them and testify that they had been a resident at the ranch and she had seen them every day.
    Beth: Many of them said, 'Well, you can just testify that I was here the last two weeks. But she'd say, 'Oh no. Oh no.'
    Robbie: Mother liked to have things nice and smooth. And no fussing and fuming.

    Beth: One guest cried for six weeks. Any time a man would walk, oh, heh, heh, it reminded her of Joe! And we finally saw Joe. And I don't know where the tears came from. Because he was no prize package, I can tell you that.

    But as a whole, most of the people who came there, they wanted a divorce, so it wasn't an unhappy time for them. They just thought it was great that there was some place they could come to get one.

    Robbie: An awful lot of them had plans for after their six weeks. When they checked in, they'd say, 'My cousin will be with us.

    Beth: They had somebody in the other room, waiting to walk down the aisle with. And six weeks later, of course, they were married.

    Robbie: Listening to stories from the guests, I think we probably thought many times, I sure won't make that mistake!

    Beth: Robbie had a good marriage with her husband. And I'd been married and divorced and then remarried. The man I remarried, his wife had been there for a divorce. He came over and asked me out for dinner. And next thing I knew, I was married. So, it was the greatest move that I think we ever made.
