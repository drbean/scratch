    "00:38 A group gathered around in chairs.
    00:42 And they were all wearing their nice Christmas clothing, 
    00:43 and I thought, Well, how nice, you know, they have no idea that I'm going to bore them to sleep with my tuning. 
    00:49 And I’m kind of working along happily and I’m smiling at people. 
    00:54 And a few of them were looking at me like, What in the world is he doing? 
    00:58 One lady was just glaring at me. 
    01:01 Another lady was giving me sympathetic looks (Her name turned out to be Rose). 
    01:06 And then the activity director comes in and says:
    01:09 OK, everybody, Miss Jennifer was here and she saw that the piano man was tuning the piano, 
    01:14 so she’ll be back in January. 
    01:18 I didn’t realize they had a concert scheduled that day. "

    "01:22 About a third of the people looked highly disappointed. 
    01:25 and they were murmuring to each other, trying to tell each other what had happened.
    01:30 The angry lady barked at me and said, you know: \"Haven't you ever heard if isn't broke, don't fix it?\" 
    01:37 And she stormed off. 
    01:38 I had scooted over on my seat out of the view of Rose because she looked so hurt.
    01:44 And suddenly, she touched my arm, and it startled me. 
    01:50 And I looked. And she was very close to me.
    01:54 And she told me very sincerely,
    01:57 I've been sitting here the whole time and 
    02:00 I've been watching what you do and I can tell that you're the kind of person 
    02:06 who would never walk away from this piano until everything was just so. 
    02:09 That was a moment where someone did just the right thing, 
    02:14 just out of the blue.
    02:17 And it did mean something to me."

    "Debra: How did you get the job as doorman at the Plaza Hotel.
    Ed: Well, my father was a garage manager at the Plaza for thirty years.
    And he was friends with all the doormen.
    And when I graduated from high school, he said,
    There's a nice job for you over there.
    Just go over and talk to somebody.
    One of the doormen was sick and they put the hat and coat on me, which fit very well.
    And they put me on the door right away.
    And I got outside and started working.
    That was my first job.
    And then, uh, it was great.
    
    Debra: What was the best tip you ever got? 
    Ed: Well, I was always tell the story about Jackie Gleason, for Christmas time. 
    He says to me, What was the biggest tip you ever got.
    And I says, Well, a hundred dollars.
    And he says, Here's a hundred and fifty dollars. Merry Christmas.
    And he says, By the way, who was the one who gave you a hundred?
    And I says, Well, that was you last year."

    "Debra: Now, I got to know you because I walk to work every morning, and I cut by the Plaza, and you made my day. \"Good morning, young lady.\" \"Beautiful day.\"
    Ed: Eh, that's what it's all about.
    Out being in front there and smiling. 
    And just making everybody happy.
    And that's the whole thing of it.
    You know, anybody that comes in here is a VIP.
    And when they tell me, Treat them like a VIP, I say I already do.

    I had a guest come in one morning, six-thirty in the morning.
    And he had to go to a very important meeting.
    And he asked me where he could get his shoes shined.
    And I says, It don't open till eight o'clock. Our barber shop.
    So I said, I tell you what. Give me the shoes and you come back in a half an hour or so and I'll have them done.
    I ran down to my locker, got my shoeshine kit, which I have in my locker to shine my shoes,
    shined them up for him,
    come back up. He come by, put his shoes on,
    and he went to the meeting, and he's one of my best friends.
    Matter of fact, he comes back to the Plaza all the time.
    You know, my father told me years ago,
    He said, Be such a man, and live such a life, that if,
    Everybody lived a life like yours, this would be God's paradise.
    And I go by that."

    00:45 And Mom told us that our aunt wanted to talk to us. 
    00:50 So we went out and got in the old pick up and drove over there. 
    00:55 And my aunt started telling us that Mom had this disease that my aunt Pearl had had and old Fred and so forth down the line. 
    01:06 That's the first day I heard the word, Alzheimers. 
    01:10 When we got back to the farm it was dark. 
    01:13 And Mom and Dad were in a fight. 
    01:15 Dad had gotten home from work and wanted to know where we were at. 
    01:18 And she had forgotten where we had gone. 
    01:21 They were yelling and screaming at each other. 
    01:23 And it was a horrible night for all of us. 
    01:26 I was the one that became the care person for my mother at that time. 
    01:30 I was thirteen. 
    01:32 I got to high school. 
    01:34 I was in my senior year. 
    01:36 And by this time, Mom was sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket wrapped around her, and all the blinds pulled down. 
    01:44 That year, she asked me if I could help her die and I told her I couldn't. 
    01:50 And after that, she started trying to run away.

    "Ed Trinka worked as a doorman at the Plaza Hotel, a very old and very famous hotel in New York. His job was to greet guests as they came into the hotel, help them get out of their cars, and help them with their bags. This was very simple to do.

    But he also had to do something which was more difficult to do. That was the job of making guests feel important and happy about staying at the Plaza. Ed did a very good job of this, because he was a happy and friendly person.

    He didn't do this because the boss, Shane, said he had to. He did it because he liked people. One time, a guest wanted his shoes shined very early in the morning, before the shoe shine stand was open, so he shone the shoes himself, not because the boss said he had to, but because Ed just wanted to help.

    He just made people around him feel happy, even when they weren't very happy before seeing him. Someone like Jackie Gleason was not a happy person, even though he made other people laugh. He used to make Jackie Gleason feel happy, so Gleason gave him very big tips. And, he was friendly even with people passing in the street like Debra Goodman."

    "Ed Trinka has now stopped working at the Plaza. He is sixty-five. He worked there for forty-six years. His father also worked at the Plaza Hotel and he got Ed the job as doorman. The employees made a lot of the decisions about who could work at the hotel. If your relatives worked at the hotel, it was easier to get a job there.

    Managers found it very difficult to control the doormen and other staff at the hotel. The staff didn't listen to the managers. Shane, the general manager told Ed to treat everyone like a VIP, but Ed didn't really listen to Shane. He told Shane I already do treat everyone like a VIP.

    Fortunately, Ed was very popular with the guests at the Plaza, a very expensive and famous old hotel. All the guests had lots of money. And many of them were famous and important. They really were VIPs.

    Ed stopped working for the Plaza for a while because he didn't like Shane telling him what to do. But when Shane asked him to come back to the Plaza Hotel, he returned. Ed said he never had a bad day working at the hotel, but that may not really be true. One thing that made Ed unhappy was the death of his wife, who was working at the hotel too. Now he is looking for a new wife."

    "Charles Jackson didn't really have a happy family life after his mother, Lotte got Alzheimer's disease. At first Jack, his father, and Lotte, argued a lot. Before he realized Lotte had Alzheimer's, Jack thought Lotte was being careless and stupid. This made him very angry with her. When Jack started shouting at Lotte, Lotte would started shouting back at him. Gradually Jack realized that Lotte's behavior wasn't under her control. But this didn't make him any happier. He was very unhappy that his wife was slowly losing her mind. All this made Charles, his brother, and especially his mother, unhappy too.

    Charles father and his brother gradually started spending as little time at home as they could. Charles' father told him it was his job to look after his mother and before he went to school in the morning and after he came home from school, he had to feed her and help her go to the bathroom.

    When he got home in the afternoon, he would always find Lotte sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket around her and the blinds pulled down. She was so unhappy that she asked Charles to help her die. Charles couldn't agree to do that.

    Later she became unable to walk. But before that she started trying to run away. She would leave the house and just walk away from the house with no idea of where she was going or what she was looking for. Charles used to lock the door to prevent her leaving, but she would try to jump out the window, or she would leave the house when Jack wasn't looking."

    "When Charles turned 50, he started having problems with memory at work and home. He couldn't remember how to get to work, and he couldn't remember if he had eaten breakfast or not. Other people were the first to notice. His wife, Carol didn't know much about Alzheimer's but she knew that Charles' mother had had Alzheimer's.

    She asked him to get diagnosed. When the doctors told him he had Alzheimer's, he already knew was the condition was like, as a result of his experience with his mother. He knew what was going to happen. He would gradually forget everything and stop doing things and would just sit in a chair all day. That was helpful to him. He didn't feel as worried as he might have about what was going to happen to him.

    A friend, Brenda sent him an email after she found out. She thought the idea of losing your mind was horrible, and felt disturbed that Charles was going to turn into this kind of person. He said he was less worried, and he asked her not to stop being a friend.

    He thought that the condition itself was not as bad as the treatment that people with Alzheimer's get from their family and friends. He remembered his father's treatment of his mother, and hoped that his wife and his children would not treat him the same way as that. He wanted them to treat him the same way as they always had. He wanted them to love him and to understand that even though he might act differently, he was still the same person inside and he was still having fun with them."

    "Sarafino: I understand your mom had breast cancer. What was that like
    Dana: It was very scary. She'd been very sick. And they took her to a hospital. And a physician came out to talk to us when we got there. And told us that she had cancer and that they didn't expect her to survive. And I remember thinking that there was a way that they could have told us that was softer.
    Sarafino: Is that why you wanted to become a cancer nurse?
    Dana: You know, I think so. I can't imagine doing anything else.
    Sarafino: How does it feel to you telling someone they're going to die.
    Dana: Oh, it's horrible. A lot of times when you get to that point, they know it. And you know it. Because they don't feel good. And they know what we're doing to them is not making them better. So a lot of times when we have that talk with them, they've kind of prepared for it.
    Sarafino: Are you friends with some patients?
    Dana: Mmh-hmm. They all teach you something. They've taught me to celebrate the smallest things in life, like hair growing back. I learn about fear. And I learn about hope, and I really learn what love is. Love is that deep, intense feeling for another person's soul. And that it's okay to let that person go. We all don't know how long we're going to be on this planet. And that's why it's important to love each other and to, you know, cherish a human being.
    Sarafino: I really think God wanted you to be what you are, because you're awesome at it. You make patients smile. You walk in there, and they're all like, Dana. Oh, my gosh, she's here. To me, you are maybe the angels on earth. You come down and try your best to heal people. You are my hero.

    Dimasi: When did you decide to give me up for adoption.
    Adam: Well, I was in my final year of university, and I wasn't in a serious relationship with anyone. It was kind of a fluke. You know they say it only takes once. And it turned out to be true. And it was probably the loneliest time of my entire life. When I was in the hospital, I was there for hours by myself. And then they took you away, and they wouldn't allow me to see you. But one of the nurses took pity on me and brought you in to my room in the middle of the night one night so that I could count fingers and toes.

    Adam: But then the other, uhm, practice was that in the case of adoption, I had to actually carry you out of the hospital and hand you to the doctor, physically. That was supposed to be an indication of my willingness to give up the child. And, that was hard.
    Dimasi: I want you to know that I never was angry. I never resented your decision. I've never had reason to. I knew that I was adopted, and my parents always made it a positive part of my life, that they picked me, that they really wanted me. And I just remember your being a question mark. That part of who I was was just a question mark. And I got to a point in my early twenties when I was just so curious ...

    "Shepard: I woke up the morning after I got to Glasgow and I decided to just go to the university to look around, see what I thought. I had the address written down for my biological father and I went there.

    I looked down the hallway and I saw a sign with his name. Finally, I just said this is probably the only chance in my life I will ever have to do this.

    Walked up to the door and knocked. He looked at me with a look that was not quite hostile, but impatient. I said, Do you have a minute? He said, Sure. And I said, Do you remember living in Connecticut 20 years ago. And he got this kind of odd smile on his face and said, Yes, I remember it.

    I said, Well, do you remember a relationship with a woman named Eloise, that you had? And he says, Yes, yes I do.

    And I says, Well, uhm, I'm the result of that relationship, And he says, Aaaaaah.

    Walks over towards me, and I have this panic that he's going to touch me. But he doesn't. He walks past me and he closes the door and walks back and sits down at the table where I'm seated, and says, So, you're here.

    And I said, Yeh. And I told him that I had three questions that I wanted to ask him. He said, Sure. And I said, First, I want to know if there is any history of diseases or things that I needed to be aware of, genetically, just to get that baseline out of the way. And, he said, No, not that I know of.

    And then I asked him if he would be willing to just explain a little the circumstances surrounding my birth, and how it came to be that I was born and he left. And for the first time and only time over the course of our fifteen-minute conversation, the grin left his face. And eventually, he said, Well, I think that at that point, Eloise was ready to have a child. And I said, And you were't. And he laughed, and said, No. Never was, never have been, He didn't really offer me anything more.

    Ryan: Did you ask your third question?

    Shepard: Yeh, I looked at him for a minute, and then I asked my third question, May I take a picture of you? I had a little disposable camera, took a picture of him, and, um, that was that.

    It ended with me, saying, Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. And I said, Goodbye, and he turned to walk back towards his computer, and he says, Goodbye for now.

    I don't know if I'll ever contact him, if I will ever want him to be a part of my life in any way. But for now, I don't.

    And, so, I walked back through this park in Glasgow back towards this place where I was staying and I felt that I had made a peace with a part of myself that I never expected, that I never even thought possible."

    PJ: That's right.
    Sam: And pretty much everybody else in our family.

    Sam: You had a fake ID.
    PJ: Mmm-mmh. Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm telling you this. And, um, I was sitting at this barstool and your dad sat down. And I said to your dad, I said,  There's somebody sitting there. And he says, I don't care. I just have to meet you. And, he made me laugh, and that's what I needed right then. That's why I needed to laugh a little.

    We talked for about four hours, and then he walked me out to my car, but he never asked me for my phone number. And I got home that night, and I was writing in my diary, Very good-looking, but insecure.

    The next day, I was on my couch watching some afternoon TV, folding laundry, and I had told dad what apartment complex I lived in, but I didn't tell him what apartment or where I lived. So he drove in to the apartment complex and just laid his hand on the horn.
    Sam: (Laughs)
    PJ: And he just was driving through the complex. (Laughs). And I went out on my balcony, and I saw him, and I said, Oh my God, that's that guy from the bar last night, and he was like, Oh, hi, there you are, I've been looking for you! And that's the way he found me.

    Sam: What was the best times, the worst times in marriage? And did you ever think of getting divorced?
    PJ: You know, over the years, I have thought about getting divorced. Me and your dad were separated once for two years, but we got back together. And we never did get divorced. We came close a couple of times during that time. Umm.
    Sam: I remember like, you were like yelling. And you said, You want me to leave with the children? I was like in my bed, and I just heard that.
    PJ: I'm sorry you had to hear that, sweetie. Marriage isn't always pretty. I think sometimes we act like little children, and we need to be more mature about it, because it's a privilege to be married to somebody, and you need not to disrespect it like that. Like sometimes we get angry and we do. But we've been together for twenty-three years now. And I think your dad's taught me the meaning of love. Love is as much a feeling as it is an action.
    Sam: Right.
    PJ: You see what I'm saying.
    Sam: I see what you're saying.
    PJ: To love somebody is not just how you feel about them, but what you do, also."

    "Time now for another moment from StoryCorps. StoryCorps is a national oral history project. Friends and family members talk about their lives in a StoryCorps recording booth. Some of their stories are heard Fridays on Morning Edition.

    Judy Allen is sixty-five years old and lives in Portland, Oregon. Her daughter, Kelly Edwards is forty four, and interviewed her mom in the StoryCorps booth at New York's Grand Central Terminal.

    Kelly: Describe a memory when you felt independent and empowered.
    Judy: I think the most empowered I've ever felt in my life was when my philandering husband told me he was going to work and I suddenly realized he'd gone to be with his girlfriend. I went to where she was staying, and found his car parked in front of her house, got a great big rock about as big as a bowling ball from somebody's garden, and heaved it through the back window of his car.

    That was wonderful. It felt great. And then I started divorce proceedings.

    Years later he called.. he sent me a message somehow, and told me that he still had some stuff of mine--books and things--that if I was ever traveling in Alaska, I should stop by and pick them up. And I was doing a business trip to Alaska, so I went up there, made an appointment, went to see him in his office, and he handed me a very heavy box, and said 'There's a lot of heavy stuff--books and stuff--in there'. And so I dragged it and schlepped it through airports all the way home. God, it was heavy. And then I got home and opened it up and, nothing in it but that rock. Which he had saved all those years.

    Judy Allen with her daughter Kelly Edwards. If you'd like to learn more about StoryCorps, its national tour and how you can participate, go to npr.org.

    I remember one time in the first grade, my teacher, she was going round to everyone, and, uh, she asked them what they wanted to be. So she got to me. And she says, Sammy Reed. They all called me Sammy, instead of Samuel. What do you want to be when you grow up. And I said I want to be an undertaker. And, everybody thought that was crazy. But I was always fascinated with the way a dead person looked when you went to see them.
    Coming up, you would listen to the elders talk about a person was killed in a car wreck.

    Coming up, you would listen to the elders talk about a person was killed in a car wreck, and they was messed up and everything. But when you got to the funeral, you would hear them say, Wow, Grandma looked great. She looked at peace. And, and I wanted to know how to do that.

    And whenever I had a pet die, you know, I always would bury the pet, on the side of the creek bank. I would have my little sisters. They would pick flowers, and we'd just stand around, have a little funeral, you know.

    So, I just knew that this was what I was destined to do, to deal with the dead.

    And, I always get this. You don't look like an undertaker. And I said, Well, what does an undertaker look like. They said, They look dead. And, they look old. And they drink a lot. I said, Well, I'm not dead. I don't think I look old, even for my age. And I said, I don't drink.

    You know, a lot of people think because we're morticians, and we're in the business of dealing with this on a day-to-day basis, that we're cold.

    You know, a lot of people think because we're morticians, and we're in the business of dealing with this on a day-to-day basis, that we're cold. But we react the same way when we lose a loved one. I mean, there's no different. And the best part is, meeting the needs of the families. Their loads should just be a little bit lighter. That's what I strive to do every day, to make people feel better.

    We need to identify the insect. That's the first thing you have to do. You have to identify the pest. Believe it or not, this is very scientific type of work.

    Uh, one of the big issues of the day is bed bugs. I had a gentleman, came in yesterday. Thought he had bed bugs. He shows me a sample. I look at it. It's a ladybug, just an Asian beetle. Big deal. And the guy almost cried.

    He's all, Thank God, I thought I had bed bugs. And I do this every day. 

    I don't respect an insect. But if you look deep enough, there's always something fascinating about even the most unpleasant creatures.

    I mean, roaches. Let's face it. Roaches are spectacular. They've been around for billions of years. There's something to be said about an insect like that.

    Then I changed the mindset, and I said, Wait. If I make somebody feel better, and he's more, you know, at ease, that's, that's golden.

    After the divorce, there wasn't much money. So my mother worked in a laundry and different places, and she finally got a job at Montgomery Ward's Department Store.

    And, these young women would come in, all dressed in these big boots and these kind of rough overalls. And, and they would have checks of six hundred dollars to cash. And she finally asked one of them, Where do you work ...

    SHIRLEY: My name is David Shirley.

    ANTHONY: And I'm Lawrence Anthony. We're in Drexel, North Carolina.

    SHIRLEY: In the back of Drexel Barber Shop.

    ANTHONY: When I was about 18 years old, my daddy wanted me to take my little brother to the neighbors to get his hair cut. And the neighbor said I was drunk last night. Ain't no way I can cut hair. You'll have to do it. I said, I ain't never cut a head of hair in my life, ain't never touched clippers. He said, you go ahead and cut it. If you mess it up, I'll straighten it out.

    I went ahead and cut my brother's hair. And got through - he said, well, that's better than I could do. So, he took his little hand clippers with comb and scissors and he said, here, I'm going to sell you these two for fifty cent. That's when I went in the barber business for fifty cent.

    SHIRLEY: We have doctors and lawyers and judges and town drunks, and people that's got a million and probably owe a million. I remember a gentleman would come in and we would ask what type of haircut he wanted. And he said, well, cut one sideburn above my ear and leave the other one below ...

     SHIRLEY: Well, if they like it, tell them I cut it. If they don't like it, tell them Lawrence cut it.

     I've been in and around barber shops all my life. There's a customer that I cut his grandfather's, his father's, his, his son's and his grandson's.  I'm on the fifth generation, and they remind you that time has elapsed.

    (Soundbite of laughter)

    ANTHONY: We've got the barber shop and there ain't much going on with Drexel no more. It's kind of just faded away. Try not to think about that too much. It might make you feel sad.

    SHIRLEY: When I think about retiring, I think, well, maybe just a little longer because I would hate to think of the time that I have to turn the key for the last time and walk off. As I get older, I think I'm a rich man - not dollar-wise necessarily; I don't mean that - but in memories and friends, I've been thoroughly blessed.
