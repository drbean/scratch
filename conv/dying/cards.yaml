        \begin{normalsize}Funeral directors--the job\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A funeral director is someone who takes the body to a place where it will remain until buried, and then prepares the remains, before performing a funeral ceremony and transporting the body to a cemetery. The job requires someone who is good at comforting the family of the dead person.
        \item [Embalming] If it will take more than 24 hours for the body to be buried or cremated (burned), most US states require the body to be embalmed or refrigerated. When embalming, funeral directors will wash the body with germ-killing soap, and replace the blood with embalming fluid that prevents the body going bad. They may reshape and reconstruct damaged bodies with clay, cotton or wax. They may also put cosmetics on the face, dress the body, and put it in a casket (box).
        \item [Funerals] In the US, burial in the ground in a casket is most common, although entombment in a structure above ground also is done. Cremation, or burning the body, is becoming increasingly popular because it can be less expensive and more convenient.
        \item [Paperwork] Funeral directors also handle the paperwork required by the government when someone dies.
        \item [Businesses] Most funeral homes are small family-run businesses.

        \begin{normalsize}Sam Reed in Oakland Cemetery\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Reed was working at a funeral home and when asked if he would be interested in the job looking after the cemetery and digging graves, he said, Yes, because he wasn't getting any benefits (eg health insurance, yearly bonus) at the funeral home.
        \item [Burials] Reed usually has one and a half days to prepare for a burial. A funeral home might call on Monday and want the burial on Wednesday. It takes 5-6 man hours to dig a grave, because they do it by hand, without a machine. The grave is 90 cm wide, 240 cm long and 180 cm (6 feet) deep.
        \item [Oakland Cemetery] It's a very old cemetery and doesn't have many new graves. They usually do one funeral a month. Reed has buried 300 people there. He doesn't think that's a lot. 
        \item [Perpetual care] The cemetery is not 'perpetual care'. 'Perpetual care' cemeteries are more expensive, because you have to pay for the cemeteries to be cared for. Most states require cemeteries to be perpetual care. Some people prefer to have their relatives buried in cemeteries which are \textbf{NOT} perpetual care, because it is cheaper.
