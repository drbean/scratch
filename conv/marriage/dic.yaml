    00:17 I was pregnant when I met him.
    00:20 And he saw me, and walked over towards me, and he said, You're going to be my wife.
    00:25 And a year later, we just one day went down to City Hall and got married. 
    00:34 And we had no rings. 
    00:35 He tried to give me his class ring, a big ugly thing, and put it on my finger. 
    00:40 And I was like, Uh-huh. 
    00:43 And I remember coming home one day, and he wasn't there. 
    00:48 And there was a note on the back of the door. 
    00:50 And it said, Go in the bedroom ..

    ... and look on the dresser. 
    00:53 And I went in the bedroom and looked on the dresser, and there was the ring box. 
    00:59 A beautiful wedding ring and engagement ring. 
    01:02 I grabbed those things. I didn't put them on. 
    01:05 I just ran out of the house, 'cause I knew where he hung out at. 
    01:08 And when he saw me coming, he said, Did you find them? 
    01:10 And I said, Yes, and I was shaking and stuff, like I had just met him. 
    01:14 And I handed him the rings and he got down on one knee. He said, Will you be my wife ..

    ... really be my wife? 
    01:22 And I said, Yeah."

    01:25 He would come home and he would say, what's for dinner?
    01:29 And I would tell him whatever dinner was going to be.
    01:33 And he made me feel like it was magnificent.
    01:37 I mean, if I burnt popcorn, it was the best, you know.
    01:41 That was the kind of guy he was.


    01:46 I was married to him for seventeen years, and we separated. And he moved to Michigan. 
    01:51 I don't know the details, but Frank got into an altercation. 
    01:57 They say that this woman was a \"damsel in distress.\"

    02:02 And Frank was helping her. And the woman's boyfriend shot him in the back. 
    02:11 I had my fourth child with him and he's exactly like his father. Exactly. 
    02:20 He never talks above a whisper. He's always happy and laughing. He's the gentleman of all gentlemen. 
    02:29 And you know my other three kids are like that because they had him. 
    02:34 My oldest son, he'll tell you, My biological father's name is So-and-so, but my dad's name is Frank Mixon. 
    02:43 And out of all the years that we were separated, I still remember Frank Mixon. 
    02:50 Because I honestly believe that he was my first true love.

    "Sam: How did you meet Dad?
    PJ: Well, you know that my mom died when I was seven.
    Sam: Yes.
    PJ: And you know that I was on my own when I was sixteen. So what I did and what you get to do are going to be two different things, because ..
    Sam: Right, I'll always have somebody looking up for me. And, that's you, Dad, and ..
    PJ: That's right.
    Sam: And pretty much everybody else in our family.
    PJ: So, I was 18 years old and, um, I had a fake ID, and I was at this bar.
    Sam: You had a fake ID.
    PJ: Mmm-mmh. Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm telling you this. And, um, I was sitting at this barstool and your dad sat down.

    PJ: And I said to your dad, I said,  There's somebody sitting there. And he says, I don't care. I just have to meet you. And, he made me laugh, and that's what I needed right then. That's why I needed to laugh a little.

    We talked for about four hours, and then he walked me out to my car, but he never asked me for my phone number. And I got home that night, and I was writing in my diary, Very good-looking, but insecure.

    The next day, I was on my couch watching some afternoon TV, folding laundry, and I had told dad what apartment complex I lived in, but I didn't tell him what apartment or where I lived. So he drove in to the apartment complex and just laid his hand on the horn.

    Sam: What was the best times, the worst times in marriage? And did you ever think of getting divorced?
    PJ: You know, over the years, I have thought about getting divorced. Me and your dad were separated once for two years, but we got back together. And we never did get divorced. We came close a couple of times during that time. Umm.
    Sam: I remember like, you were like yelling. And you said,

    Sam: "You want me to leave with the children?" I was like in my bed, and I just heard that.
    PJ: I'm sorry you had to hear that, sweetie. Marriage isn't always pretty. I think sometimes we act like little children, and we need to be more mature about it, because it's a privilege to be married to somebody, and you need not to disrespect it like that. Like sometimes we get angry and we do. But we've been together for twenty-three years now. And I think your dad's taught me the meaning of love. Love is as much a feeling as it is an action.
    Sam: Right.
    PJ: You see what I'm saying.
    Sam: I see what you're saying.
    PJ: To love somebody is not just how you feel about them, but what you do, also."

    "Edwards: Describe a memory when you felt independent and empowered.
    Allen: I think the most empowered I've ever felt in my life was when my philandering husband told me he was going to work and I suddenly realized he'd gone to be with his girlfriend. I went to where she was staying, and found his car parked in front of her house, got a great big rock about as big as a bowling ball from somebody's garden, and heaved it through the back window of his car.

    That was wonderful. It felt great. And then I started divorce proceedings.

    Robbie: Most of the guests came from New York, New Jersey. At the end of their six weeks, Mother would go to court with them and testify that they had been a resident at the ranch and she had seen them every day.
    Beth: Many of them said, 'Well, you can just testify that I was here the last two weeks. But she'd say, 'Oh no. Oh no.'
    Robbie: Mother liked to have things nice and smooth. And no fussing and fuming.

    Beth: One guest cried for six weeks. Any time a man would walk, oh, heh, heh, it reminded her of Joe! And we finally saw Joe. And I don't know where the tears came from. Because he was no prize package, I can tell you that.

    But as a whole, most of the people who came there, they wanted a divorce, so it wasn't an unhappy time for them. They just thought it was great that there was some place they could come to get one.

    Robbie: An awful lot of them had plans for after their six weeks. When they checked in, they'd say, 'My cousin will be with us.

    Beth: They had somebody in the other room, waiting to walk down the aisle with. And six weeks later, of course, they were married.

    Robbie: Listening to stories from the guests, I think we probably thought many times, I sure won't make that mistake!

    Robbie: Listening to stories from the guests, I think we probably thought many times, I sure won't make that mistake!
    Beth: Robbie had a good marriage with her husband. And I'd been married and divorced and then remarried. The man I remarried, his wife had been there for a divorce. He came over and asked me out for dinner. And next thing I knew, I was married. So, it was the greatest move that I think we ever made.
