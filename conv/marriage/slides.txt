## Rose Garden

- [Lynn Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO4wcNVbYOQ)
- [Rose Garden Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beKFjPEU_Fw)

| I beg your pardon,
| I never promised you a rose garden.
| Along with the sunshine,
| There's gotta be a little rain sometimes.
| When you take, you gotta give, so live and let live,
| Or let go.
| I beg your pardon,
| I never promised you a rose garden.
| I could promise you things like big diamond rings,
| But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover.
| So you better think it over.
| Well, if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true,
| I would give you the world right now on a silver platter,
| But what would it matter?
| So smile for a while and let's be jolly:
| Love shouldn't be so melancholy.
| Come along and share the good times while we can.
| I beg your pardon,
| I never promised you a rose garden.
| Along with the sunshine,
| There's gotta be a little rain sometimes.
| Instrumental break.
| I beg your pardon,
| I never promised you a rose garden.
| I could sing you a tune or promise you the moon,
| But if that's what it takes to hold you,
| I'd just as soon let you go, but there's one thing I want you to know.
| You better look before you leap, still waters run deep,
| And there won't always be someone there to pull you out,
| And you know what I'm talkin' about.
| So smile for a while and let's be jolly:
| Love shouldn't be so melancholy.
| Come along and share the good times while we can.
| I beg your pardon,
| I never promised you a rose garden.
| Along with the sunshine,vi
