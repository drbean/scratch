# Evaluation

## Evaluations and Grades

The teacher gives the students grades.

If the students get a low grade, they fail.

The students give the teacher an evaluation.

If teachers get low evaluations more than twice, the school will not allow them to teach.

## Dr Bean's low evaluations

The dean, Peter 夏, told Dr Bean he needs to get better evaluations to continue to teach at 明新. His evaluations by students have been low.

## Dr Bean's questions

What does he need to do to get better evaluations from the students?

What aspects of his teaching does he need to improve?

## Competition, Advanced Level, Control

Competition: Dr Bean makes students compete. One student gets a high/low score, and the other gets a lower/higher score.

Advanced Level: Dr Bean teaches at an advanced level. Students have problems understanding him.

Control: Dr Bean doesn't let students do what they want. He controls what students do.

As for these 3 aspects of his teaching, are you

1. very dissatisfied?
1. somewhat dissatisfied?
1. neither satisfied nor dissatisfied?
1. satisfied?
1. very satisfied?

Rate him as a group, after discussing with your group what score he should get.

Add one aspect of his teaching he needs to work on to improve his teaching.
