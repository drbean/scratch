    The story about the Spanos running a restaurant is about hard work. The son expected to come in and be the boss, but his father made him do less satisfying work, like washing dishes. He wanted him to learn that it's important to do every job to the best of your ability. The son comes to love running the restaurant.

    The story about the Sunshine Hotel is a less happy story. A lot of the people living there don't have good lives. They do not have money and they do not have family and friends. They never get out of their rooms. Eddie has been at the hotel for thirty years.

    The story about Carrie Conley bringing up six children by herself is happier. She doesn't have any money either, but by stretching the dollar she is able to feed her children and have them enjoy Christmas. She is happy that her children are good and successful people.

    The Spanos in the first story were successful in setting up a restaurant, even though they had no experience in cooking before. Because they worked hard and were careful about small details, they were able to get many customers. Unfortunately they were not able to compete with cheaper chain restaurants. So they closed down.

    In the story about the Sunshine Hotel, Nathan, the manager tells about the people living there. Many take drugs or are always drunk. Nathan is sad that the people don't have good lives. But he is happy that he can make their lives better by giving them a home.

    Carrie Conley in the third story worked very hard, even when she was sick, so that her children could have many toys and lots of good food at Christmas. Her husband had left her and she had to bring up her children alone. Her children loved her for what she did for them.

    The younger Spano says in the first story that he would not close down the restaurant, even if he had a lot of money. Joe enjoys making people happy with his food. Guests also enjoy going to the restaurant because they like to see Joe's interest in what they think about the food. He is very happy when they eat everything on the plate.

    Max, one of the people in the Sunshine Hotel in the second story, had left his family and his job and was taking drugs. He realized what he was doing was not good. But he wanted to do it anyway. Finally the police come and take him away from the hotel.

    In the third story, Christmas is a happy time for Jerry and the rest of Carrie Conley's children. Many parents tell their children Santa Claus brings Christmas presents. But Carrie didn't. She didn't want them to think that their father, or another man, was doing this for them.

    The Spanos say in the first story that it is important to do your best even with work that doesn't seem important. Joe Jr tells how one night when his dishwasher was sick, he washed the dishes himself. The cooks were surprised, but he tells them that this is why the restaurant is successful. He tells them this is what his father taught him.

    The Sunshine Hotel in the second story is the one of the last cheap hotels in New York City. People with money are moving into the area. The hotel may not continue to exist. The people living there may have to live on the street or in the subway.

    The black woman in the third story, Carrie Conley was already working before her husband left her. After he left, she continued to work. Her husband did not give her any money after he left, but by buying cheap food and second hand clothes and toys, she was able to feed her kids.
