  \item [The job]
    Your job is to follow the orders of the doctors and look after patients who have cancer. This is very difficult because almost all your patients die, even though you work very hard. You give them medicine so they don't feel pain, prepare them for surgery, feed them, and give them chemical treatments. It is not a pleasant job.
  \item [Your feelings about the job]
    Your mother was a cancer patient and you felt bad about the experience. The doctors were not very gentle with her, or with you, when they told you they didn't expect her to survive. You wanted to do something so that other people would not feel bad. 
  \item [Your family]
    Your mother died of breast cancer, the most common cause of death by cancer among women in the US. Perhaps she would be surprised you became a nurse.\\
    Your daughter admires you. Perhaps you would try to discourage her from becoming a nurse.
  \item [Your relationship with patients]
    They are not happy a lot of the time. Sometimes, however, they become happy, like when their hair starts growing back, after radiation treatment. Perhaps hair growing back isn't a little thing, but even little things make them happy.\\
    You have learned from them what love is. Love is an intense feeling for someone's soul, but the willingness to let that person go, when they die. You think everyone should love someone.

  \item [Cancer]
    Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of tissue in parts of the body. It is a major cause of death. About 13 percent of all deaths are caused by the different forms of cancer. Cancer can occur at all ages, but the risk increases with age. All animals can suffer from cancer. Cancer is caused by a combination of genetic factors and carcinogens, like smoking.
  \item[Cancer treatment]
    It is treated by surgery, ie cutting out the tissue, by radiation, ie X-ray light on the tissue, and by chemicals, ie drugs. The chances of survival depend on the type of cancer and the stage at which it is discovered. Nowadays, many more people survive than used to.
  \item[Pain and other symptoms]
    Doctors and nurses have in recent years shown more concern for the pain, vomiting and other problems that cancer patients suffer. Pain is due to the damage of the body by the cancer or due to the treatment. Before, doctors did not like to give patients morphine or other addictive drugs to patients, even when they were near death. Now they are more willing to do this.
  \item[International differences]
    Liver cancer is most common in Taiwan, with men most likely to have liver and mouth cancer and women most likely to have breast and cervical cancer. In the U.S., more people die from lung cancer than any other cancer. Prostate and lung cancer are most common in men, and breast and lung cancer are most common in women.
