        \item [Syndromic retardation] Sometimes (not always) mentally retarded people have other medical problems, eg as in Down's Syndrome.
         \item [Euphemisms] Whatever name is chosen eventually becomes insulting. 'Mental retardation' is regarded as a bad word. Instead, say, 'intellectual disability', 'intellectually challenged', or 'developmental disability'.

Renee turned around, and with the same kind of voice, but very loudly, said, "That's me!" You were so embarrassed, you wanted to shrink into the ground.
      B: You are not a shrinking violet. You like people to notice you. But you have mixed feelings about people's reactions to your artificial voice. You don't like them to talk about it. You are unhappy when Amanda calls your voice "funny." You like it when Rita remembers you and gives you special treatment.

        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Causes] People who smoke are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alchohol also increases the risk of getting throat cancer.
        \item [Symptoms] The doctor will perform a physical exam. This may show a lump on the outside of the neck. High-pitched breathing sounds are also associated with throat cancer.
        \item [Treatment] The goal of treatment is to completely remove the cancer and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body.

        \begin{description}
        \item [Surgery] Some patients need surgery to remove the vocal cords. If you lose your vocal cords, speech therapy can help you learn other ways to speak.
        \item [Early detection] If throat cancer is detected early, treatment will cure the cancer in 90 percent of cases.
        \item [Middle-stage detection] If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, in 50-60 percent of cases treatment will be successful.
        \item [Late detection] If the cancer has spread to the head and neck, the cancer is not curable.

        \begin{normalsize}Quadriplegia\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A total or partial loss of use of all the limbs and torso (ie, paralysis) caused by illness or injury. Paraplegia is similar but does not affect the arms. Both sensation and motor control are lost.
        \item [Cause] Usually damage to the brain or to the top of the spinal cord, in a car crash, fall or sports injury. But disease and congenital disorders can also result in paralysis.
        \item [Broken neck] You can break your neck without becoming paralyzed if the spinal cord is not damaged. It is also possible to cut the spinal cord without breaking the spine, (eg, if something sticks into the spine.)

        \begin{normalsize}CPR\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Manually pushing the blood around the body to prevent brain damage, in cases where a person's heart has stopped. The hands are used to press in the chest at least 5cm at a rate of 100 times per minute.
        \item [Purpose] Not to restart the heart or to make the person start breathing, but to keep the brain alive until the heart restarts by itself, or until doctors can restart it.
        \item [Survival rates] All cases where CPR is used: only 5-10 percent. Cases where CPR is started straight away, and doctors arrive in 3-5 minutes: more than 5-10 percent. In Seattle: 30 percent. In NY: 1-2 percent.
