        \item [Syndromic retardation] Sometimes (not always) mentally retarded people have other medical problems, eg as in Down's Syndrome.
         \item [Euphemisms] Whatever name is chosen eventually becomes insulting. 'Mental retardation' is regarded as a bad word. Instead, say, 'intellectual disability', 'intellectually challenged', or 'developmental disability'.

      A: You were in the gym. You heard this strange sound. It sounded like music, or an insect. You said, "What's that funny sound?" You didn't mean to embarrass anyone. Renee turned around, and with the same kind of voice, but very loudly, said, "That's me!" You were so embarrassed, you wanted to shrink into the ground.
      B: You are not a shrinking violet. You like people to notice you. But you have mixed feelings about people's reactions to your artificial voice. You don't like them to talk about it. You are unhappy when Amanda calls your voice "funny." You like it when Rita remembers you and gives you special treatment.
      C: You work as a hostess at a restaurant. You don't really want Renee coming to your restaurant, because her voice disturbs the other customers. But you can't refuse to let her in. So you try to be pleasant and to welcome her warmly. You find her a good table where she has some privacy and the other customers cannot hear her.
