        \item [Career] Richard Coleman was a sergeant in the Air Force for 20 years, until he retired in 1986, at the age of 38. He has been in the Scouts all his life, including while he was in the Air Force. 
        \item [Attitudes] He thinks Derek Connell and other scouts in the troop are very dedicated. He says this makes him work hard to lead the troop. The scouts' parents say they have never met anyone like Richard and Claudia. They are very involved in each of their scouts' lives, and help them develop as much as they can.

        \begin{description}
        \item [Description] The disorder appears before adulthood. The problem is (1) not thinking and speaking well, and (2) not being able to lead a normal life. Usually mental retarded people have IQs below 70.
        \item [Syndromic retardation] Sometimes (not always) mentally retarded people have other medical problems, eg as in Down's Syndrome.
         \item [Euphemisms] Whatever name is chosen, eventually becomes insulting. 'Mental retardation' is regarded as a bad word. Instead, say, 'intellectual disability', 'intellectually challenged', or 'developmental disability'.
