    Richard: Derek, I joined your troop in 1987. I had two daughters, so in a way this was a 'night out with the boys.'
    Claudia: I wanted to be part of the group, too. And I became an assistant scoutmaster to Troop 409.
    Richard: And Derek, why did you want to become a boy scout?
    Derek: Because I saw it in the World Book. I've been doing scouting for almost twenty-six years. And it's hard to believe that our troop's lasted that long.
    Richard: Since we're registered as a special needs group, we have no age limit. That's why Derek, when he was about 34, was able to make Eagle. And you were my first Eagle, right?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: Why did you stay in the boy scouts all these years?
    Derek: Because everybody needs my help. Because some of 'em are a little slow, Some of 'em can't read and write.
    Richard: Now these guys all work together. You remember Randy? He's on his wheelchair?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: We took him to summer camp with us. And since we're in the Panhandle of Florida, there's a lot of soft sand. And try and maneuver a wheelchair around is kind of hard. And this is how resourceful these scouts are. They came up with an idea that if they harnessed themselves to the wheelchair. Randy could sit back there and yell 'Mush.'
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: It was like a dog sled. And they would drag him around camp like this.
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: So, we're the can-do troop. I try not to pay attention to what their problems are. 'Cause when I've got 'em. they're all scouts.
    Derek: The thing is, if we can't do something right, they don't get mad about it. Some people, you know, if you can't do it right, phfft, that's it.
    Claudia: We are so proud of this troop. It has become a huge part of our life.
    Richard: How would you describe Derek?
    Claudia: Dedicated.
    Richard: And you're our troop historian, aren't you?
    Derek: Yeh. Mmh-hmm.
    Claudia: I'd just like to, uh, thank Derek for all the help and all the encouragement you give the new scouts in the troop, Derek.
    Derek: You're welcome.
    Claudia: And I told your mom, that you carried the spirit of Troop 409 in your heart. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
    Derek: Thank you.
    Claudia: Thank you, Derek.
