    Richard: Derek, I joined your troop in 1987. I had two daughters, so in a way this was a 'night out with the boys.'
    Claudia: I wanted to be part of the group, too. And I became an assistant scoutmaster to Troop 409.
    Richard: And Derek, why did you want to become a boy scout?
    Derek: Because I saw it in the World Book. I've been doing scouting for almost twenty-six years. And it's hard to believe that our troop's lasted that long.
    Richard: Since we're registered as a special needs group, we have no age limit. That's why Derek, when he was about 34, was able to make Eagle. And you were my first Eagle, right?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: Why did you stay in the boy scouts all these years?
    Derek: Because everybody needs my help. Because some of 'em are a little slow, Some of 'em can't read and write.
    Richard: Now these guys all work together. You remember Randy? He's on his wheelchair?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: We took him to summer camp with us. And since we're in the Panhandle of Florida, there's a lot of soft sand. And try and maneuver a wheelchair around is kind of hard. And this is how resourceful these scouts are. They came up with an idea that if they harnessed themselves to the wheelchair. Randy could sit back there and yell 'Mush.'
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: It was like a dog sled. And they would drag him around camp like this.
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: So, we're the can-do troop. I try not to pay attention to what their problems are. 'Cause when I've got 'em. they're all scouts.
    Derek: The thing is, if we can't do something right, they don't get mad about it. Some people, you know, if you can't do it right, phfft, that's it.
    Claudia: We are so proud of this troop. It has become a huge part of our life.
    Richard: How would you describe Derek?
    Claudia: Dedicated.
    Richard: And you're our troop historian, aren't you?
    Derek: Yeh. Mmh-hmm.
    Claudia: I'd just like to, uh, thank Derek for all the help and all the encouragement you give the new scouts in the troop, Derek.
    Derek: You're welcome.
    Claudia: And I told your mom, that you carried the spirit of Troop 409 in your heart. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
    Derek: Thank you.
    Claudia: Thank you, Derek.

    David: Mary who was, uh, who is the most important person in your life?

    Mary: My sister. I really look up to her, and she is a great person no matter her room is messy.

    David: So you remember when you were young and on Friday nights you and your sister and I would dance in the living room? We'd take out the coffee table and turn up the music and we'd get on our backs and be like bugs? (laughs).

    Mary: Yes.

    David: Is there something about me that you've always wanted to know but you've never asked me?

    Mary: Yes Dad. How did you feel when I was born and how did mom feel?

    David: Well that's a complicated question. Um, we didn't know we were going to have a little girl so that's the first thing we thought we were really pleased to have another little girl.  And then when we learned you had Down syndrome I think we both decided that we had to figure it all out and, so we went to classes and we read books and we talked to other people. But about 2 months later I think we just kind of relaxed and realized we just needed to raise you with love and teach you like we did your big sister and everything would turn out alright and I think it has.

    Mary: Um, you tell me I'm special all the time. What makes me special?

    David: Well there's a lot of things that are special about you. You know your mom and I we both really admire you because you are so positive, because you work really hard for everything that you get, and you go out of your way to make sure that everybody's doing okay. Not everybody's like that, in fact I told somebody just the other day that I want to be more like my daughter Mary when I grow up. Do you have other questions?

    Mary: No, I don't. Back to you.

    David: Back to me, huh ? What one thing about me upsets you? I'm not sure I wanted to ask that (laughs).

    Mary: (laughs) Um, if you, like, tell me exactly what to do.

    David: (laughs) So you don't like it when I raise my voice, huh?

    Mary: Yeah.

    David: Are there some things you want to ask me about you?

    Mary: Yes. What is your goal for me?

    David: What are mom and my goal for you?

    Mary: Yes.

    David: Well, I hope most of all that you keep your sunny personality no matter what you do. And I hope you find somebody you love and have a family in whatever way you have a family. And we're really looking forward to getting to know you as an adult, because you've been such a great kid.

    Mary: Thanks.

    Michelle: How do you feel when people turn around and look at you?

    Renee: It aggravates me. I was in the gym the other day, and I was talking to somebody. And there was a woman, and she turned around and she said, at the top of her voice: What's that funny sound? And I turned around, with my hands on my hips. I said, that's me. And she wanted to shrink into the ground. I felt so good.

    Michelle: That's one thing that I love about you. You do still stick up for yourself.

    Renee: I'm not a shrinking violet. But, you know, there's some good sides. When people phone me to solicit and I say hello, they think I'm playing a joke on them, and there's this long silence.

    Michelle: You told me that when you answered, they said: Is this a computer that I'm speaking to? And you said, yes.

    Renee: People are really very kind once they realize what the situation is. I may go into a restaurant once, and if I go back there a year later, and it's the same woman at the front desk, she'll say, where have you been? We haven't seen you for a while. So I feel like a movie star.

    I remember the night before my operation. I was scared. I asked you to stay, and you slept in the bed with me, in the hospital. And then you left New York to come and be with me for a year. How did you feel about leaving your job and your friends and your life?

    Michelle: I didn't even think twice about it.

    Renee: I'm really very blessed in my life. I am happier now, without my voice, than I've ever been with my voice. It's a small price to pay for being alive and enjoying life. So I am very happy where I am now.

    Tom: One day the surf was up, down at the beach, so I caught a wave and was gliding down the face, and went up to do a trick. I timed it wrong and went headfirst into about a foot and a half of water. I had a loud ringing in my ears, and I couldn't move and I couldn't breathe. And I realized that my neck was broken. I thought: This can't be it; I can't just die. My body just went limp. I was dead, they think, for about 15 minutes before I was resuscitated.

    Connie: We prayed and prayed for a miracle, and the miracle of him walking and moving again never happened, but we do realize he should have been brain damaged, and he's not - any more than he was before.

    Tom: That's debatable, right? You know, I went from being so active and a Type A personality, and I was always go, go, go. And then all of a sudden, it's just, you know, my life came to a screeching halt. Now, I'm completely reliant on others.

    Every night, you guys stretch my muscles and move my joints around, and then in order to have a bowel movement, stick a suppository in my rectum. And that was tough at first, but now, Mom, as you always say:

    Connie: Routine maintenance.

    Tom: Yup, routine maintenance. I don't think we would've laughed this hard if it weren't for my injury. I can credit my lack of depression to you guys. But the only regret I think that I have in life is not getting closer to you before my injury, because I was always out with my friends.

    And Dad, I don't think you realize how highly I think of you. I mean, I look at you, and you make me want to be a better man.

    Robert: Well, I'd like to think that I'm not doing anything different than any other father would do.

    Tom: Mom, you don't make me want to be a better woman, but I love you, and I don't know what I'd do without you. I remember thinking when I first got hurt that I didn't, I didn't want to live like this.  But I think with parents like you and the support that I have, I still have a life.
