    Richard: Derek, I joined your troop in 1987. I had two daughters, so in a way this was a 'night out with the boys.'
    Claudia: I wanted to be part of the group, too. And I became an assistant scoutmaster to Troop 409.
    Richard: And Derek, why did you want to become a boy scout?
    Derek: Because I saw it in the World Book. I've been doing scouting for almost twenty-six years. And it's hard to believe that our troop's lasted that long.
    Richard: Since we're registered as a special needs group, we have no age limit. That's why Derek, when he was about 34, was able to make Eagle. And you were my first Eagle, right?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: Why did you stay in the boy scouts all these years?
    Derek: Because everybody needs my help. Because some of 'em are a little slow, Some of 'em can't read and write.
    Richard: Now these guys all work together. You remember Randy? He's on his wheelchair?
    Derek: Mmh-hmm.
    Richard: We took him to summer camp with us. And since we're in the Panhandle of Florida, there's a lot of soft sand. And try and maneuver a wheelchair around is kind of hard. And this is how resourceful these scouts are. They came up with an idea that if they harnessed themselves to the wheelchair. Randy could sit back there and yell 'Mush.'
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: It was like a dog sled. And they would drag him around camp like this.
    Derek: Ha-ha!
    Richard: So, we're the can-do troop. I try not to pay attention to what their problems are. 'Cause when I've got 'em. they're all scouts.
    Derek: The thing is, if we can't do something right, they don't get mad about it. Some people, you know, if you can't do it right, phfft, that's it.
    Claudia: We are so proud of this troop. It has become a huge part of our life.
    Richard: How would you describe Derek?
    Claudia: Dedicated.
    Richard: And you're our troop historian, aren't you?
    Derek: Yeh. Mmh-hmm.
    Claudia: I'd just like to, uh, thank Derek for all the help and all the encouragement you give the new scouts in the troop, Derek.
    Derek: You're welcome.
    Claudia: And I told your mom, that you carried the spirit of Troop 409 in your heart. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
    Derek: Thank you.
    Claudia: Thank you, Derek.

    Michelle: How do you feel when people turn around and look at you?

    Renee: It aggravates me. I was in the gym the other day, and I was talking to somebody. And there was a woman, and she turned around and she said, at the top of her voice: What's that funny sound? And I turned around, with my hands on my hips. I said, that's me. And she wanted to shrink into the ground. I felt so good.

    Michelle: That's one thing that I love about you. You do still stick up for yourself.

    Renee: I'm not a shrinking violet. But, you know, there's some good sides. When people phone me to solicit and I say hello, they think I'm playing a joke on them, and there's this long silence.

    Michelle: You told me that when you answered, they said: Is this a computer that I'm speaking to? And you said, yes.

    Renee: People are really very kind once they realize what the situation is. I may go into a restaurant once, and if I go back there a year later, and it's the same woman at the front desk, she'll say, where have you been? We haven't seen you for a while. So I feel like a movie star.

    I remember the night before my operation. I was scared. I asked you to stay, and you slept in the bed with me, in the hospital. And then you left New York to come and be with me for a year. How did you feel about leaving your job and your friends and your life?

    Michelle: I didn't even think twice about it.

    Renee: I'm really very blessed in my life. I am happier now, without my voice, than I've ever been with my voice. It's a small price to pay for being alive and enjoying life. So I am very happy where I am now.
