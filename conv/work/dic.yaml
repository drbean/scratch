    "00:38 A group gathered around in chairs.
    00:42 And they were all wearing their nice Christmas clothing, 
    00:43 and I thought, Well, how nice, you know, they have no idea that I'm going to bore them to sleep with my tuning. 
    00:49 And I'm kind of working along happily and I'm smiling at people. 
    00:54 And a few of them were looking at me like, What in the world is he doing? 
    00:58 One lady was just glaring at me. 
    01:01 Another lady was giving me sympathetic looks (Her name turned out to be Rose). 
    01:06 And then the activity director comes in and says:
    01:09 OK, everybody, Miss Jennifer was here and she saw that the piano man was tuning the piano, 
    01:14 so she'll be back in January. 
    01:18 I didn't realize they had a concert scheduled that day. "

    01:25 and they were murmuring to each other, trying to tell each other what had happened.
    01:30 The angry lady barked at me and said, you know: \"Haven't you ever heard if isn't broke, don't fix it?\" 
    01:37 And she stormed off. 
    01:38 I had scooted over on my seat out of the view of Rose because she looked so hurt.
    01:44 And suddenly, she touched my arm, and it startled me. 
    01:50 And I looked. And she was very close to me.
    01:54 And she told me very sincerely,
    01:57 I've been sitting here the whole time and 
    02:00 I've been watching what you do and I can tell that you're the kind of person 
    02:06 who would never walk away from this piano until everything was just so. 
    02:09 That was a moment where someone did just the right thing,

    02:17 And it did mean something to me."

    Debra: How did you get the job as doorman at the Plaza Hotel.
    Ed: Well, my father was a garage manager at the Plaza for thirty years.
    And he was friends with all the doormen.
    And when I graduated from high school, he said,
    There's a nice job for you over there.
    Just go over and talk to somebody.
    One of the doormen was sick and they put the hat and coat on me, which fit very well.
    And they put me on the door right away.
    And I got outside and started working.
    That was my first job.
    And then, uh, it was great.

    And he says, By the way, who was the one who gave you a hundred?
    And I says, Well, that was you last year.
    Debra: Now, I got to know you because I walk to work every morning, and I cut by the Plaza, and you made my day. \"Good morning, young lady.\" \"Beautiful day.\"

    I had a guest come in one morning, six-thirty in the morning.
    And he had to go to a very important meeting.
    And he asked me where he could get his shoes shined.
    And I says, It don't open till eight o'clock. Our barber shop.
    So I said, I tell you what. Give me the shoes and you come back in a half an hour...

    Matter of fact, he comes back to the Plaza all the time.

    You know, my father told me years ago,
    He said, Be such a man, and live such a life, that if, everybody lived a life like yours, this would be God's paradise.

    "Ed Trinka worked as a doorman at the Plaza Hotel, a very old and very famous hotel in New York. His job was to greet guests as they came into the hotel, help them get out of their cars, and help them with their bags. This was very simple to do.

    But he also had to do something which was more difficult to do. That was the job of making guests feel important and happy about staying at the Plaza. Ed did a very good job of this, because he was a happy and friendly person.

    He didn't do this because the boss, Shane, said he had to. He did it because he liked people. One time, a guest wanted his shoes shined very early in the morning, before the shoe shine stand was open, so he shone the shoes himself, not because the boss said he had to, but because Ed just wanted to help.

    He just made people around him feel happy, even when they weren't very happy before seeing him. Someone like Jackie Gleason was not a happy person, even though he made other people laugh. He used to make Jackie Gleason feel happy, so Gleason gave him very big tips. And, he was friendly even with people passing in the street like Debra Goodman."

    "Ed Trinka has now stopped working at the Plaza. He is sixty-five. He worked there for forty-six years. His father also worked at the Plaza Hotel and he got Ed the job as doorman. The employees made a lot of the decisions about who could work at the hotel. If your relatives worked at the hotel, it was easier to get a job there.

    Managers found it very difficult to control the doormen and other staff at the hotel. The staff didn't listen to the managers. Shane, the general manager told Ed to treat everyone like a VIP, but Ed didn't really listen to Shane. He told Shane I already do treat everyone like a VIP.

    Fortunately, Ed was very popular with the guests at the Plaza, a very expensive and famous old hotel. All the guests had lots of money. And many of them were famous and important. They really were VIPs.

    Ed stopped working for the Plaza for a while because he didn't like Shane telling him what to do. But when Shane asked him to come back to the Plaza Hotel, he returned. Ed said he never had a bad day working at the hotel, but that may not really be true. One thing that made Ed unhappy was the death of his wife, who was working at the hotel too. Now he is looking for a new wife."

    "Sarafino: I understand your mom had breast cancer. What was that like?
    Dana: It was very scary. She'd been very sick. And they took her to a hospital. And a physician came out to talk to us when we got there. And told us that she had cancer and that they didn't expect her to survive. And I remember thinking that there was a way that they could have told us that was softer.
    Sarafino: Is that why you wanted to become a cancer nurse?
    Dana: You know, I think so. I can't imagine doing anything else.
    Sarafino: How does it feel to you telling someone they're going to die.
    Dana: Oh, it's horrible. A lot of times when you get to that point, they know it. And you know it. Because they don't feel good. And they know what we're doing to them is not making them better. So a lot of times when we have that talk with them, they've kind of prepared for it.
    Sarafino: Are you friends with some patients?
    Dana: Mmh-hmm. They all teach you something. They've taught me to celebrate the smallest things in life, like hair growing back. I learn about fear. And I learn about hope, and I really learn what love is. Love is that deep, intense feeling for another person's soul. And that it's okay to let that person go. We all don't know how long we're going to be on this planet. And that's why it's important to love each other and to, you know, cherish a human being.
    Sarafino: I really think God wanted you to be what you are, because you're awesome at it. You make patients smile. You walk in there, and they're all like, Dana. Oh, my gosh, she's here. To me, you are maybe the angels on earth. You come down and try your best to heal people. You are my hero.

They all called me Sammy, instead of Samuel. What do you want to be when you grow up. And I said I want to be an undertaker. And, everybody thought that was crazy. But I was always fascinated with the way a dead person looked when you went to see them.

Ain't no way I can cut hair. You'll have to do it. I said, I ain't never cut a head of hair in my life, ain't never touched clippers. He said, you go ahead and cut it.

    Hi, I'm Bill Schifrin. I specialize, selling wedding rings to the public, and I have such a good time doing it.
    
    I'm always working, twenty-four hours a day. When I would see a couple on the street, kissing, in a clinch, I would tap on the shoulder of the fellow. I would hand the fellow a card. You know why? Because married couples don't kiss on the street.
    
    Years ago, used to be very busy on Friday afternoons. The couple would come, and he would let her pick a wedding ring and give me a check as a deposit.

And before there was telephones in Vineyard Haven, I would go from house to house picking up the orders for Cronig's Market. And every house I went to they insisted that I have breakfast. Oh, they were good cooks. They made beautiful pastry. Oh, I got fat as fat could be.

I said to myself, my gosh, I don't know how to cook, do I? But I did. And I didn't realize I knew. I learned by watching my grandmother and my mother, and now you're doing it.

    Son: Now we're feeding a thousand people a week.

    Father: Yeah, amazing, isn't it? That's a lot of pasta.

    Son: I never realized before I started working with you, you sure knew how to drew the line between son and employee. And I mean I can remember when I was the first dishwasher at Spano's ..

    Father: Yeah. I'm the son, I'm supposed to be the executive.  

    Son: Right, I didn't think I was supposed to be the dishwasher.

    Father: You wanted to be president.

    Son: Right. I did. I wanted to walk in, I wanted to wear a shirt and tie my first day on the job.

    Father: But you also saw your dad washing dishes too at that same sink.

    Son: I don't know if you knew early on that I was going to want to do this forever. I don't know if that was part of it and you were trying to teach me or if you were just doing it because that's way it's supposed to be.

    Father: No, we were trying to teach you a work ethic; whether you were in a restaurant business or not, I think we did a heck of a job.

    Son: Right, but it wasn't until started doing it for myself that I realized, okay, this is why they did it the way they did it.

    Father: Yeah, well, you know, they say the older you get, the smarter your parents get.

    Son: Yeah, I'm real - now I know. Just this past Friday night, my dishwasher got sick and the guys in the kitchen were busy and I took my coat off and I took my tie off and I put an apron on and I started scrubbing dishes. And I mean the guys in the kitchen, they were amazed.

    Son: No, but if I hit the lottery tomorrow and never had to work another day in my life, I would not close the restaurant down.

    Father: Um-hum.

    Son: Because, you can have all the money in the world, but if you don't do something that has any meaning, I mean, what's the point? When somebody's plate comes back completely empty, that's instant gratification. Or they were starving to death, one of the two, and that makes it all worthwhile. There's no other job like that. You know, at least every day I can make somebody happy.

    The guy that was interviewing told me I was too little, that I wouldn't get along with the guys, that they would make life hard for me.  He didn't think I needed to be doing it.

    And my dad said, "Well, you know, my Uncle Alf is superintendent out there. I can get you on like that." Finally, at the end of that week I let my dad take me to see Uncle Alf.

    So, I went the next Monday and the guy said, "Look, I got the word from the top. I don't like it, but you're hired."

    Then I went to the ship. And none of the guys would work with me. They said, "These are men's jobs. You're taking jobs away from men who have families." I said, "I have a family and no man and I need money."

    It took about two weeks before I started proving myself. And the guys were doing better with it. They would work with me. I had several guys who told me, "You need to slow down--you're making us look bad." (Laughs) You know? And I'm like, "I'm here to work!"

    We had to go to school two nights a week. And I was the first apprentice who had ever become supervisor before graduation. And they were mad because I got a raise. And I got a position they thought was theirs. It's just... I had a knack for getting stuff done on time and getting it done right.

    Now, I had to do some things a little differently than they did, you know?  I couldn't lift an 80 pound transformer. But I found a way to do the same things they were doing. And it kind of made me better than I probably would have been if I was a guy.

    Abreu: When I came here, I thought I spoke English, um, so I took a job as a receptionist. English was easy for me to understand if you have the person right in front of you, because you can read their lips, you can read, you know, their body language. But when you take a job as a receptionist you're pretty much on the phone. So over the phone is, is a completely different story.

    And the biggest struggle was to take messages because if you pronounce a word in Spanish or a name in Spanish you write it the exact same way. In English, it is completely different. So I had to be, you know, picking up the spelling of the names, so that was very hard.

    And I had a very very demanding boss. She would stand in front of me just to hear how I would answer the phone. So what I did was, I sat down with my ten-years-old niece and picked up the, uh white pages, the phone book, and I said you're going to dictate names to me, and I was spelling those names. So I sat down every night for a week.

    And I got to be an expert in picking up names and spelling the names and numbers. It was really challenging for me to do that but I, one thing that I like to do is work hard for what I want. And um, it sounds funny now, but at the time it was scary because I really needed the job and I was able to keep it because I was able to practice my (laughs) spelling.

   Tia: All the girls I went to high school with would talk about being teachers and when I went to college I started to study things I really loved and that's when I started taking finance and accounting courses.  And this miserable old man--I had him for second year accounting and business law--he said to me, "Ms. Casciato, you are the only woman who has ever gotten this far in my class. And I will make sure every day is a living hell for you."

   And he used to grade us on our class participation and how we would answer questions. And he said to me at the beginning of every class, "I hope you are prepared, Ms. Casciato, because the most difficult question of the period will be yours." And I would smile. I mean, this is how backward the world was.

   Christine: So then you graduated from Douglass. And how many job interviews did you have to go on?

   Tia: I think I wrote 80 letters. I don't know how many jobs I applied to and when I went in for the first interview--and this is like a vivid memory--I owned one dress. It was shades of red and pink and these big block geometric squares. It had short sleeves and it was a mini-dress and I had tights and heels on. And I walked in and this guy--he interviewed me for 15 minutes and then he said, "You need to stand up and turn around."

   And I said, "What are you talking about?"

   He said, "Stand up and turn around."

   And I stood up and I leaned over his desk and I said, "I don't need this job this much."

   And that's when he said, "You're hired."

   That's the way it was. And I think it's like that today only it's much more subtle.

   Christine: How hard was it then to work and take care of Steven and then me later on.

   Tia: I really had this idea that I could do everything a hundred percent. You know like you can be a hundred percent worker, a hundred percent mother, a hundred percent wife. And you can't. It's impossible.  And you have these terrible decisions to make: Do you stay home? Do you work? Do you go after the brass ring in your career? What do you do with your children? You unconditionally love them and you would give anything for them. You would give up your life, your career, your home. It's complicated. It's complicated.

    Queen Jackson: I was working for the state of Colorado. And I had all these great ideas of retiring and sitting back and enjoying my life. But as the budget was becoming very strained, I was one of the first to be laid off. Well, I had some money in savings. And I thought, no big deal, I can go out and get another job. Well it didn't happen that way. One week turned into another, a month, five months. And the unemployment was not covering my rent. Therefore I lost my apartment.

    My daughter, you know, she wants so badly for me to move in with her. But I'm of a generation in which your children don't take care of you; you take care of your children, you know. I remember I didn't have the money to buy her a birthday card. And I thought, I'm gonna go out with this sign, "Will Work for Whatever".

    Well dummy me, I get dressed like I'm going to a job interview, and I had to laugh at myself, I'm like, you're looking like, you know, pretty middle class out here. But, this man handed me a 10-dollar bill. I thanked him, and I bought my daughter a card. That meant so much to me.

    I remember it was Christmas. I was in the shelter and um ' I just started remembering when my daughters were little girls. You know, the smells of cooking, the joy. I felt so lonely. But I'll never forget, the women received a gift bag. I got a little bottle of lotion, I opened it up, and I smelled it, and it was the most beautiful fragrance I had ever smelled. And I remember crying because it lifted my spirits so.

    You know in my 30s or 40s, nobody could have told me that I was gonna be homeless at the age of 60. It was a bullet I didn't see coming. Not at all.
