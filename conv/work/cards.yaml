        \begin{normalsize}Funeral directors--the job\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A funeral director is someone who takes the body to a place where it will remain until buried, and then prepares the remains, before performing a funeral ceremony and transporting the body to a cemetery. The job requires someone who is good at comforting the family of the dead person.
        \item [Embalming] If it will take more than 24 hours for the body to be buried or cremated (burned), most US states require the body to be embalmed or refrigerated. When embalming, funeral directors will wash the body with germ-killing soap, and replace the blood with embalming fluid that prevents the body going bad. They may reshape and reconstruct damaged bodies with clay, cotton or wax. They may also put cosmetics on the face, dress the body, and put in a casket (box).
        \item [Funerals] In the US, burial in the ground in a casket is most common, although entombment in a structure above ground also is done. Cremation, or burning the body, is becoming increasingly popular because it can be less expensive and more convenient.
        \item [Paperwork] Funeral directors also handle the paperwork required by the government when someone dies.
        \item [Businesses] Most funeral homes are small family-run businesses.

        \begin{normalsize}Sam Reed in Oakland Cemetery\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Reed was working at a funeral home and when asked if he would be interested in the job looking after the cemetery and digging graves, he said, Yes, because he wasn't getting any benefits (eg health insurance, yearly bonus) at the funeral home.
        \item [Burials] Reed usually has one and a half days to prepare for a burial. A funeral home might call on Monday and want the burial on Wednesday. It takes 5-6 man hours to dig a grave, because they do it by hand, without a machine. The grave is 90 cm wide, 240 cm long and 180 cm (6 feet) deep.
        \item [Oakland Cemetery] It's a very old cemetery and doesn't have many new graves. They usually do one funeral a month. Reed has buried 300 people there. He doesn't think that's a lot. 
        \item [Perpetual care] The cemetery is not 'perpetual care'. 'Perpetual care' cemeteries are more expensive, because you have to pay for the cemeteries to be cared for. Most states require cemeteries to be perpetual care. Some people prefer to have their relatives buried in cemeteries which are \textbf{NOT} perpetual care, because it is cheaper.

        \begin{normalsize}Job of pest controller\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Pest control workers remove unwanted creatures like roaches, rats, ants and fleas. They rely on their knowledge of pests and use many types of chemicals, traps, and other equipment. They may even cut or drill into buildings. The final choice of action may be left to the consumer.
        \item [Actions] Pest controllers use general-use insecticides and restricted-use pesticides that the government only allows to professionals. They also use `integrated pest management' to try to prevent pests coming back.
        \item [Integrated pest management] The use of a number of different techniques, like baits, traps, and physical barriers together with chemicals is popular, because pesticides harm the environment and the pests soon return.
        \item [Training] The government requires pest controllers to have training. A person with a high school diploma can apply to do certification tests. Entry-level training usually requires 10 hours in the classroom and 60 hours on the job. But they must continue to attend training sessions throughout their careers. Employers usually also want people who are good communicators and who can do physically hard work, eg sliding into narrow crawlspaces in winter.
        \item [Employment] There are more jobs in the South and in large cities. There will continue to be many jobs open for pestcontrollers, because many people don't like the work. The average earnings was \$13/hour in 2006.

        \begin{normalsize}Andy Linares' story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Start] In the Storycorps soundfile, Linares suggests he started work as a pest controller after he couldn't find a job using his graduate degree in political science. In fact, he started working for his uncle's pest control company, Matador, when he was in high school. Then it was simply a way to make money.
        \item [Dream] While in graduate school, he worked at the United Nations organizing meetings, but the job led nowhere, although his French became very good. He felt like he had hit a brick wall at the UN, so he left to find a job in an international institution or company. But he was unsuccessful.
        \item [Company owner] Finally, he bought his uncle's pest control business from him when he retired, but he wasn't happy.
        \item [Changes] It's not clear why he finally came to be happy with his job. Anyway, after taking over his uncle's pest control company, he made changes. He started selling pesticides to smaller companies that needed supplies. He also ran training programs for people who wanted to get pest control licenses. Now, he also runs exhibitions where pest control companies come and show what they are doing.
        \item [Satisfaction] He says he is generous with his knowledge, and it's satisfying to know he's helped people.

        \begin{normalsize}Women in men's jobs during World War II\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The need for women] World War II started in the US in 1941. Women were brought into war work from 1942. Men were going to war and many industries were switching to war production. At first, there was lots of reluctance on the parts of managers, husbands, male workers, and many women, too.
        \item [Groups of women workers] Some women were already working, for example in laundries, like Dorothy Butler. Others had worked before but had lost their jobs. The third group was first-time workers. Many were married, white and middle-class and had to be encouraged to stop being housewives and go out to work.
        \item [Propaganda] The US government got magazines, movies and other forms of mass media to promote the idea of women helping the war effort. There was a song called Rosie the Riveter and images of women working appeared on posters and magazine covers.
        \item [War effort] When the war work got going, the US produced phenomenal amounts of war material. A shipyard in California, like the one Dorothy Butler was working at, produced 747 ships in 5 years. One time, they produced a ship in 5 days. Usually, it took them 2 weeks.
        \item [Women's Liberation] It is not clear whether women's war work affected the position of women after the war. Did their working sow the seeds of the second wave of feminism, ie Women's Liberation? Anyway, the number of working women never again fell to pre-war levels. The recognition that middle-class married women could work and run a home was significant. 
        \item [What women said] Inez Sauer: "   "My mother warned ... 'You will never want to go back to being a housewife.' At that time I didn't think it would change a thing. But she was right, it definitely did. . . . at Boeing I found a freedom and an independence that I had never known. After the war I could never go back to playing bridge .." Inez Sauer, Boeing tool clerk. \\
        "You came out to California, put on your pants, and took your lunch pail to a man's job. This was the beginning of women's feeling that they could do something more." Sybil Lewis, Lockheed riveter.

        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Early life] She was born in 1907 in Portland. Her father was the pastor in a church. She got married to Charles Kelley in 1927, and got divorced in 1942, after 15 years of marriage, taking her four children, Joan, John (born 1931), Joyce (born 1933), and Robert Eaton.
        \item [Supporting the family] Although her husband regularly sent her money after the divorce, she needed to also go to work. sometimes at two jobs, to support her children. From 1943 until World War II ended in 1945, she was a welder on the Liberty Ships in the South Portland shipyard.  After the war, she worked days at Portland's Montgomery Ward department store and evenings as a paper sorter in the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook, a job she held until her retirement in 1957. 
        \item [Re-marriage] She was married to Forrest Hamblen, 1948-1952. She then married Roger Meserve and that marriage continued until his death in 1985.
        \item [Interests] Among other things, she wrote poetry. Her interest in reading and writing was passed on to her children. She continued reading until her death in 2002, despite eyesight problems.
        \item [Children] John became a university biology professor. Joyce Butler studied English in college but after getting married became a writer about the history of Maine, the area where she and her mother live. And Robert Eaton writes novels.
