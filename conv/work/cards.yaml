        \begin{normalsize}Funeral directors--the job\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A funeral director is someone who takes the body to a place where it will remain until buried, and then prepares the remains, before performing a funeral ceremony and transporting the body to a cemetery. The job requires someone who is good at comforting the family of the dead person.
        \item [Embalming] If it will take more than 24 hours for the body to be buried or cremated (burned), most US states require the body to be embalmed or refrigerated. When embalming, funeral directors will wash the body with germ-killing soap, and replace the blood with embalming fluid that prevents the body going bad. They may reshape and reconstruct damaged bodies with clay, cotton or wax. They may also put cosmetics on the face, dress the body, and put in a casket (box).
        \item [Funerals] In the US, burial in the ground in a casket is most common, although entombment in a structure above ground also is done. Cremation, or burning the body, is becoming increasingly popular because it can be less expensive and more convenient.
        \item [Paperwork] Funeral directors also handle the paperwork required by the government when someone dies.
        \item [Businesses] Most funeral homes are small family-run businesses.

        \begin{normalsize}Sam Reed in Oakland Cemetery\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Reed was working at a funeral home and when asked if he would be interested in the job looking after the cemetery and digging graves, he said, Yes, because he wasn't getting any benefits (eg health insurance, yearly bonus) at the funeral home.
        \item [Burials] Reed usually has one and a half days to prepare for a burial. A funeral home might call on Monday and want the burial on Wednesday. It takes 5-6 man hours to dig a grave, because they do it by hand, without a machine. The grave is 90 cm wide, 240 cm long and 180 cm (6 feet) deep.
        \item [Oakland Cemetery] It's a very old cemetery and doesn't have many new graves. They usually do one funeral a month. Reed has buried 300 people there. He doesn't think that's a lot. 
        \item [Perpetual care] The cemetery is not 'perpetual care'. 'Perpetual care' cemeteries are more expensive, because you have to pay for the cemeteries to be cared for. Most states require cemeteries to be perpetual care. Some people prefer to have their relatives buried in cemeteries which are \textbf{NOT} perpetual care, because it is cheaper.

        \begin{normalsize}Job of pest controller\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Pest control workers remove unwanted creatures like roaches, rats, ants and fleas. They rely on their knowledge of pests and use many types of chemicals, traps, and other equipment. They may even cut or drill into buildings. The final choice of action may be left to the consumer.
        \item [Actions] Pest controllers use general-use insecticides and restricted-use pesticides that the government only allows to professionals. They also use `integrated pest management' to try to prevent pests coming back.
        \item [Integrated pest management] The use of a number of different techniques, like baits, traps, and physical barriers together with chemicals is popular, because pesticides harm the environment and the pests soon return.
        \item [Training] The government requires pest controllers to have training. A person with a high school diploma can apply to do certification tests. Entry-level training usually requires 10 hours in the classroom and 60 hours on the job. But they must continue to attend training sessions throughout their careers. Employers usually also want people who are good communicators and who can do physically hard work, eg sliding into narrow crawlspaces in winter.
        \item [Employment] There are more jobs in the South and in large cities. There will continue to be many jobs open for pestcontrollers, because many people don't like the work. The average earnings was \$13/hour in 2006.

        \begin{normalsize}Andy Linares' story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Start] In the Storycorps soundfile, Linares suggests he started work as a pest controller after he couldn't find a job using his graduate degree in political science. In fact, he started working for his uncle's pest control company, Matador, when he was in high school. Then it was simply a way to make money.
        \item [Dream] While in graduate school, he worked at the United Nations organizing meetings, but the job led nowhere, although his French became very good. He felt like he had hit a brick wall at the UN, so he left to find a job in an international institution or company. But he was unsuccessful.
        \item [Company owner] Finally, he bought his uncle's pest control business from him when he retired, but he wasn't happy.
        \item [Changes] It's not clear why he finally came to be happy with his job. Anyway, after taking over his uncle's pest control company, he made changes. He started selling pesticides to smaller companies that needed supplies. He also ran training programs for people who wanted to get pest control licenses. Now, he also runs exhibitions where pest control companies come and show what they are doing.
        \item [Satisfaction] He says he is generous with his knowledge, and it's satisfying to know he's helped people.

      A: You get a call from Debbie, an old classmate in graduate school. She has bed bugs. You talk with her about her career. She was very good at French and got a good job with a French company in New York. She was happy but now she is unhappy and wants to change careers.

        \begin{normalsize}Hair dressers--the job in the US\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Licenses/Training] All hair dressers need to be licensed in the US. This usually requires a high school diploma, and also graduation from a hair dressing school. After graduation, there is a government exam that may include a practical test. Full-time programs usually last 9 months, but most professionals take advanced classes to keep up with new trends. Licenses are issued by state governments. so it is difficult for hair dressers to move to work in another state.
        \item [Employment] About half of all hairdressers are self-employed, having their own salon, or renting a chair from a salon's owner. Nearly every town in the US has a barber shop or beauty salon, but most hair dressers are concentrated in the cities. Many full-time barbers work 40 hours per week, but longer hours (often in the evening) are common. Many determine their own hours and about 30\%  are part-time.
        \item [Money] The average cost of a haircut in the US is \$21-45, but you can also pay \$800. The average hourly wage of hairdressers is \$11. Wages vary greatly depending on the location of the hair salon, and your ability to attract and hold customers.
        \item [The future] The number of jobs for hair dressers is expected to increase faster than jobs for other people until 2018. Opportunities for beginners should be good, but competition for top-paying jobs will be strong.

        \begin{normalsize}Life in Drexel\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The place] Drexel is in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the south-east of the United States. People there used to be called `hillbillies.' Most Americans looked down on them, because they were poor and rough. However, people liked their music, and, when recorded from the mid-1920s, it contributed to the creation of `country music.'
        \item [Lawrence Anthony] Anthony, who died in December, 2009, was born about the time that the music started becoming popular, 80 years ago. Besides being a barber, Anthony also liked to play traditional styles of country music on guitar. Amateur guitarists from the area gathered in the back of his barber shop on Saturdays, to play with him. Those `picking sessions' may or may not be continuing. There's not much happening in Drexel now.
        \item [Drexel Furniture Company] The company, started in 1903, was one of a number of furniture makers in the Piedmont area. The supply of wood and cheap labor there was good, But, the quality of their furniture was poor. Gradually, however, Drexel grew to become the third biggest furniture company in the US, making many different styles of medium-priced furniture. But since the 1990's, with the economic slow-down in the US, Drexel's factories have closed one after the other, and the furniture is now made outside the US.

        \begin{normalsize}Dr Bean's father's career\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Dr Bean's father, Bill, started working soon after World War 2 as a chemical engineer. He stayed with his company, a paint manufacturer, for 30 years, and ended up as the plant manager.
        \item [Ending] He left the company because there was no opportunity for advancement and spent the last 10 years of his career as the manager of a sewerage treatment plant.
        \item [Interests] This description of his career gives no indication of his real interests, which were building and sailing boats. When he was younger, he had been interested in hiking and a number of other recreations, but after getting married and building a house for the family (his father had been a builder), sailing and building boats became his prime interest. In the evenings after work, he would work on the boats. He lived for the weekend. He got up earlier on the weekend than he did during the week to go sailing in summer and build boats in the winter.
        \item [Children] Dr Bean's mother says his three sons are all the opposite to him. They are all `workaholics,' and have no interests outside their work. One is a theater director and the other is a graphic (book) designer. However, perhaps they selected careers where they did not have to divide their lives into the `work' and `play' sections the way their father had to.

        \begin{normalsize}Dr Bean's career\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Before] Like Andy Linares, who didn't intend to become a pest controller, Dr Bean didn't intend to be an English teacher. In fact, he didn't see himself as having a regular career. It was only 15 years after dropping out from graduate school, that he got a job he stayed in for more than a year. when he started working as an editor at The Korea Times, It was the experience of learning Japanese in Japan that made English teaching very interesting for him.
        \item [Starting] Clearly, the reason he started working regularly was to support his wife, who he had met in Japan. He used to joke about English teaching, `I'm only in it for the money.' But clearly he enjoyed teaching too.
        \item [Life outside work] Although Dr Bean may appear to be a `workaholic,' he does have interests outside teaching English. For him, computer programming is relaxing. Only incidentally does it help him in his classes. He finds teaching stressful. He can't get the students to do what he wants them to do. But he can get the computer to do what he wants it to do. He enjoys that.
        \item [Career] Dr Bean is not sure if he has a `career.' He has a job. He has work. He is happy doing what he is doing, But he doesn't want recognition for his work, and he doesn't want a position in society. He is glad that he can get paid for doing what he likes to do.
