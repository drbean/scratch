        \begin{normalsize}Funeral directors--the job\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A funeral director is someone who takes the body to a place where it will remain until buried, and then prepares the remains, before performing a funeral ceremony and transporting the body to a cemetery. The job requires someone who is good at comforting the family of the dead person.
        \item [Embalming] If it will take more than 24 hours for the body to be buried or cremated (burned), most US states require the body to be embalmed or refrigerated. When embalming, funeral directors will wash the body with germ-killing soap, and replace the blood with embalming fluid that prevents the body going bad. They may reshape and reconstruct damaged bodies with clay, cotton or wax. They may also put cosmetics on the face, dress the body, and put in a casket (box).
        \item [Funerals] In the US, burial in the ground in a casket is most common, although entombment in a structure above ground also is done. Cremation, or burning the body, is becoming increasingly popular because it can be less expensive and more convenient.
        \item [Paperwork] Funeral directors also handle the paperwork required by the government when someone dies.
        \item [Businesses] Most funeral homes are small family-run businesses.

        \begin{normalsize}Sam Reed in Oakland Cemetery\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Reed was working at a funeral home and when asked if he would be interested in the job looking after the cemetery and digging graves, he said, Yes, because he wasn't getting any benefits (eg health insurance, yearly bonus) at the funeral home.
        \item [Burials] Reed usually has one and a half days to prepare for a burial. A funeral home might call on Monday and want the burial on Wednesday. It takes 5-6 man hours to dig a grave, because they do it by hand, without a machine. The grave is 90 cm wide, 240 cm long and 180 cm (6 feet) deep.
        \item [Oakland Cemetery] It's a very old cemetery and doesn't have many new graves. They usually do one funeral a month. Reed has buried 300 people there. He doesn't think that's a lot. 
        \item [Perpetual care] The cemetery is not 'perpetual care'. 'Perpetual care' cemeteries are more expensive, because you have to pay for the cemeteries to be cared for. Most states require cemeteries to be perpetual care. Some people prefer to have their relatives buried in cemeteries which are \textbf{NOT} perpetual care, because it is cheaper.

        \begin{normalsize}Job of pest controller\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Pest control workers remove unwanted creatures like roaches, rats, ants and fleas. They rely on their knowledge of pests and use many types of chemicals, traps, and other equipment. They may even cut or drill into buildings. The final choice of action may be left to the consumer.
        \item [Actions] Pest controllers use general-use insecticides and restricted-use pesticides that the government only allows to professionals. They also use `integrated pest management' to try to prevent pests coming back.
        \item [Integrated pest management] The use of a number of different techniques, like baits, traps, and physical barriers together with chemicals is popular, because pesticides harm the environment and the pests soon return.
        \item [Training] The government requires pest controllers to have training. A person with a high school diploma can apply to do certification tests. Entry-level training usually requires 10 hours in the classroom and 60 hours on the job. But they must continue to attend training sessions throughout their careers. Employers usually also want people who are good communicators and who can do physically hard work, eg sliding into narrow crawlspaces in winter.
        \item [Employment] There are more jobs in the South and in large cities. There will continue to be many jobs open for pestcontrollers, because many people don't like the work. The average earnings was \$13/hour in 2006.

        \begin{normalsize}Andy Linares' story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Start] In the Storycorps soundfile, Linares suggests he started work as a pest controller after he couldn't find a job using his graduate degree in political science. In fact, he started working for his uncle's pest control company, Matador, when he was in high school. Then it was simply a way to make money.
        \item [Dream] While in graduate school, he worked at the United Nations organizing meetings, but the job led nowhere, although his French became very good. He felt like he had hit a brick wall at the UN, so he left to find a job in an international institution or company. But he was unsuccessful.
        \item [Company owner] Finally, he bought his uncle's pest control business from him when he retired, but he wasn't happy.
        \item [Changes] It's not clear why he finally came to be happy with his job. Anyway, after taking over his uncle's pest control company, he made changes. He started selling pesticides to smaller companies that needed supplies. He also ran training programs for people who wanted to get pest control licenses. Now, he also runs exhibitions where pest control companies come and show what they are doing.
        \item [Satisfaction] He says he is generous with his knowledge, and it's satisfying to know he's helped people.

        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The need for women] World War II started in the US in 1941. Women were brought into war work from 1942. Men were going to war and many industries were switching to war production. At first, there was lots of reluctance on the parts of managers, husbands, male workers, and many women, too.
        \item [War effort] A shipyard in California, like the one Dorothy Kelley was working at, where 25\% of the workers were women, produced 747 ships in 5 years. One time, they produced a ship in 5 days. Usually, it took them 2 weeks.
        \item [Groups of women workers] Some women were already working, for example in laundries, like Dorothy Kelley Others had worked before but had lost their jobs. The third group was first-time workers. Many were married, white and middle-class and had to be encouraged to stop being housewives and go out to work.
        \item [Women's Liberation] It is not clear whether women's war work affected the position of women after the war. Did their working sow the seeds of the second wave of feminism, ie Women's Liberation?
        \item [Women's voices] "My mother warned, 'You will never want to go back to being a housewife.' She was right. At Boeing I found a freedom and an independence that I had never known." Inez Sauer, Boeing clerk.\\
        "You came out to California, put on your pants, and took your lunch pail to a man's job. This was the beginning of women's feeling that they could do something more." Sybil Lewis, Lockheed riveter.

        \item [Supporting the family] Although her husband regularly sent her money after the divorce, she needed to also go to work. sometimes at two jobs, to support her children. From 1943 until World War II ended in 1945, she was a welder on the Liberty Ships in the South Portland shipyard.  After the war, she worked days at Portland's Montgomery Ward department store and evenings as a paper sorter in the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook, a job she held until her retirement in 1957. 
        \item [Re-marriage] She was married to Forrest Hamblen, 1948-1952. She then married Roger Meserve in 1953 and that marriage continued until his death in 1985.
        \item [Interests] Among other things, she wrote poetry. Her interest in reading and writing was passed on to her children. She continued reading until her death in 2002, despite eyesight problems.
        \item [Children] John became a university biology professor. Joyce Butler studied English in college but after getting married became a writer about the history of Maine, the area where she and her mother live. And Robert Eaton writes novels.

        \begin{normalsize}Hair dressers--the job in the US\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Licenses/Training] All hair dressers need to be licensed in the US. This usually requires a high school diploma, and also graduation from a hair dressing school. After graduation from the school, there is a government exam that may include a practical test. Full-time programs usually last 9 months, but most professionals take advanced classes to keep up with new trends. Licenses are issued by state governments. so it is difficult for hair dressers to move to another state without doing additional training.
        \item [Employment] About half of all hairdressers are self-employed, having their own salon, or renting a chair from a salon's owner. Nearly every town in the US has a barber shop or beauty salon, but most hair dressers are concentrated in the cities. Many full-time barbers work 40 hours per week, but longer hours (often in the evening) are common. Many determine their own hours and about 30\%  are part-time.
        \item [Prices] The average cost of a haircut in the US is \$21-45, but you can also pay \$800.
        \item [Wages] The average hourly wage of hairdressers, including tips, is \$11. Wages vary greatly depending on the location of the hair salon, and the ability to attract new customers. Being able to attract and hold new customers is an important determiner of how much money a hairdresser can make.
        \item [The future] The number of jobs for hair dressers is expected to increase faster than jobs for other people until 2018. Opportunities for beginners should be good, but competition for top-paying jobs will be strong.

        \begin{normalsize}Life in Drexel\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [The place] Drexel is in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the south-east of the United States. The people in the area used to be called `hillbillies.' Most Americans looked down on them, because they were poor and rough. However, people liked their music, and, when recorded from the mid-1920s, it contributed to the creation of 'country music,' a popular style of music in the US and around the world.
        \item [Lawrence Anthony] Anthony, who died in December, 2009, was born about the time that the music started becoming popular, 80 years ago. Besides being a barber, Anthony also liked to play traditional styles of country music on guitar. Amateur guitarists from the area gathered in the back of his barber shop on Saturdays, to play with him. Those 'picking sessions' may or may not be continuing with his death. Probably they have ended.
        \item [Economic conditions] Drexel now is almost a `ghost town.' About 2,000 people live in the town and the unemployment rate is about 10\%. From the 1920's to the 1990's, however, business in the town was good.
        \item [Drexel Furniture Company] The Drexel Furniture Company, started in 1903, was one of a number of furniture companies in the Piedmont area. The area was suitable for furniture making because of the supply of wood, cheap labor and water power. However, the quality of the furniture was poor. Gradually, however, Drexel grew to become the third biggest furniture company in the US, making many different styles of medium-priced furniture. Conditions for workers were okay, but not great. Unions were not allowed in the company. Since the 1990's, with the economic slow-down in the US, Drexel's factories have closed one after the other, and the furniture is now made outside the US.
