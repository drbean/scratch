        \begin{normalsize}Funeral directors--the job\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] A funeral director is someone who takes the body to a place where it will remain until buried, and then prepares the remains, before performing a funeral ceremony and transporting the body to a cemetery. The job requires someone who is good at comforting the family of the dead person.
        \item [Embalming] If it will take more than 24 hours for the body to be buried or cremated (burned), most US states require the body to be embalmed or refrigerated. When embalming, funeral directors will wash the body with germ-killing soap, and replace the blood with embalming fluid that prevents the body going bad. They may reshape and reconstruct damaged bodies with clay, cotton or wax. They may also put cosmetics on the face, dress the body, and put in a casket (box).
        \item [Funerals] In the US, burial in the ground in a casket is most common, although entombment in a structure above ground also is done. Cremation, or burning the body, is becoming increasingly popular because it can be less expensive and more convenient.
        \item [Paperwork] Funeral directors also handle the paperwork required by the government when someone dies.
        \item [Businesses] Most funeral homes are small family-run businesses.

        \begin{normalsize}Sam Reed in Oakland Cemetery\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Starting] Reed was working at a funeral home and when asked if he would be interested in the job looking after the cemetery and digging graves, he said, Yes, because he wasn't getting any benefits (eg health insurance, yearly bonus) at the funeral home.
        \item [Burials] Reed usually has one and a half days to prepare for a burial. A funeral home might call on Monday and want the burial on Wednesday. It takes 5-6 man hours to dig a grave, because they do it by hand, without a machine. The grave is 90 cm wide, 240 cm long and 180 cm (6 feet) deep.
        \item [Oakland Cemetery] It's a very old cemetery and doesn't have many new graves. They usually do one funeral a month. Reed has buried 300 people there. He doesn't think that's a lot. 
        \item [Perpetual care] The cemetery is not 'perpetual care'. 'Perpetual care' cemeteries are more expensive, because you have to pay for the cemeteries to be cared for. Most states require cemeteries to be perpetual care. Some people prefer to have their relatives buried in cemeteries which are \textbf{NOT} perpetual care, because it is cheaper.

        \begin{normalsize}Job of pest controller\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Pest control workers remove unwanted creatures like roaches, rats, ants and fleas. They rely on their knowledge of pests and use many types of chemicals, traps, and other equipment. They may even cut or drill into buildings. The final choice of action may be left to the consumer.
        \item [Actions] Pest controllers use general-use insecticides and restricted-use pesticides that the government only allows to professionals. They also use `integrated pest management' to try to prevent pests coming back.
        \item [Integrated pest management] The use of a number of different techniques, like baits, traps, and physical barriers together with chemicals is popular, because pesticides harm the environment and the pests soon return.
        \item [Training] The government requires pest controllers to have training. A person with a high school diploma can apply to do certification tests. Entry-level training usually requires 10 hours in the classroom and 60 hours on the job. But they must continue to attend training sessions throughout their careers. Employers usually also want people who are good communicators and who can do physically hard work, eg sliding into narrow crawlspaces in winter.
        \item [Employment] There are more jobs in the South and in large cities. There will continue to be many jobs open for pestcontrollers, because many people don't like the work. The average earnings was \$13/hour in 2006.

        \begin{normalsize}Andy Linare's story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Start] In the Storycorps soundfile, Linares suggests he started work as a pest controller after he couldn't find a job using his graduate degree in political science. In fact, he started working for his uncle's pest control company, Matador, when he was in high school. Then it was simply a way to make money. He said he enjoyed getting paid well. He said he spent the money to help pay for school and girls.
        \item [Dream] While in graduate school, he worked at the United Nations organizing meetings, but the job led nowhere, although his French became very good. He felt like he had hit a brick wall at the UN, so he left to find a job in an international institution or company. But he was unsuccessful.
        \item [Company owner] Finally, he bought his uncle's pest control business from him when he retired, but he wasn't happy.
        \item [Changes] It's not clear why he finally came to be happy with his job. But perhaps it is because, after taking over his uncle's pest control company, he made changes which have been satisfying to him. He started selling pesticides to smaller companies that needed supplies. He also ran training programs for people who wanted to get pest control licenses. Now, he also runs exhibitions where pest control companies come and show what they are doing.
        \item [Satisfaction] He says there is a great deal of satisfaction in knowing he's helped improve people's lives.
