    Noe: I was eight years old - I think second grade. I would literally go outside my house, there was like a little bench, I'd put all my products there and sell them. I didn't make much. I made, what, 20 bucks a week? But for an eight-year-old, you're a millionaire with that kind of money.

    Alex: That's a lot of comic books and stuff, yeah.

    Noe: But the thing is, I wasn't like other kids. I didn't go buy Pokemon cards. (Laughs) The little money I made, I gave it to my mom. The first time, I remember she was cooking. And, uh, I came up to her and I told her, "Mom, I know you don't have money, so here's 15 bucks I made." She turned off the stove. She turned around, started crying and hugged me.  From that point on I just dedicated on [sic] getting money for my family.

    Alex: How did you make that money?

    Noe: First of all, the one thing that comes to people's mind in a bad neighborhood is drugs. But I did not sell drugs. The reason for that is, first of all, I know it's wrong. Secondly, I picture my mom. How disappointed she'll be if she finds that out. So, I actually started helping on a construction site. And this was in fifth grade. It was bad on my bones. I like, I have bad shoulders, bad knees from all the stuff I was carrying.

    Alex: When you were younger, did you realize kind of like, hey, this isn't normal or this isn't what other people go through?

    Noe: Well, I always knew I was poor. But I remember one time, in particular. My shoes were all scraped up, so I got paint and I painted them white. Some kid fell and tripped in front of my shoes and noticed.  And he pointed it out and, uh, laughed. And that's when it hit me really hard like, I'm actually poorer than I thought.

    Alex: How's your first semester of college been?

    Noe: Things are great. I just think about it, like, being the first one to go to college in my whole family of like fifty of us. That's my biggest motivation.

    Alex: I'm really proud of you that you went this far. And I just want to have you come back in like ten years, dressed really sharp. You know, in like, a suit.

    Noe: Nice shoes (laughs).

    Alex: Nice shoes, and finally have a pair that you haven't painted. You know, and I've had so many students where everything's stacked against them. What happens is they get almost there, and then they just quit. You know, I really want you to be the one that finished. To be the one that actually did it. And I want you to get everything you've ever wanted.

    Kenneth: I think that one of the best things that's happened since we both came to Washington in 2004 was coming back here with mom for the swearing in ceremony, where you were sworn into the U.S. House of Representatives.
 
    Because if you think about how we grew up, as poor as we were--I know that Dad and Mom were always really proud of the fact that all eight of their kids became first generation college graduates. And I think that we grew up so close together--you know we did everything together. We made our own carretas--our--
 
    John: Toys.
 
    Kenneth: Wheelbarrows, because we couldn't afford to buy toys. And you remember those days--we couldn't afford a bike--and so we spend our time doing whatever we could.
 
    John: Right. I went to school with one shoe one kind, and one of the other. You remember that? Leroy would wear out his right shoe, and I'd wear out my left shoe, and so I would get Leroy's hand-me-downs, because Dad could only afford one pair of shoes. And I remember walking to school, and my left foot was like size 10, and my right foot was only a size five. That was so embarrassing. But I thank God we had to go through stuff like that.

    Mary: We had a butcher around the corner from us. And he knew Mama couldn't afford to buy stuff for us. So he would save all the marrow bones. And we would go up there. And he would get, give us all the bones. And Mama would make the soup out of that. And then we had a Jewish neighborhood that we called Prince Street. And we would go up there and get a bag full of greens for five cents. I remember that. With everything in it. And she would make vegetable soup.

    And then on the first floor, there was a German couple, came over with a little baby. They had no money. And Mama, no matter what she came home with, it would be a head of cabbage, she would send half of it down there for them to eat. She'd shared whatever little she had with this couple.

    Charles: Did you guys have a wardrobe full of clothes when you were growing up?

    Mary: Oh. No, we didn't. Whatever Mama would get from the people that she worked for is what we wore. And I don't ever remember going to the store and say, get a pair of shoes, you know to fit you. Or, buy a dress, or .. No such thing. I mean we just didn't do things like that. Mama just didn't have that kind of money. Not saying that we looked dowdy. We looked very .. She was very fussy and kept us clean. She said, "You don't have to be dirty to be poor."
    And I remember Mama couldn't feed us anymore, we were growing. So, she had opportunity to place me in a home up in Maplewood, where I would work for my keep. And I would come home on every other Sunday and every Thursday.

    Charles: How long did you work for that family?

    Mary: Two years, 'til I was 16.
    Charles: And then what. Did you quit? Or what happened?
    Mary: Oh, yeh, I did quit. Well, Mama worked across the street from there, washing clothes. And it was a hot summer day and she was walking down the street. And she always would stop and see me. And I saw her coming down the street. And I ran to the front door and called her in, and, to visit with her. And after she left, Mrs. Blaisdell said to me, "Don't ever let the .. the help come in the front door! You come in the back door." And I said, "Well, then I'm not, I don't want to work here then, if my mother can't come in the front door," and I packed my little suitcase and walked all the way, a mile down to the trolley car, and came home.
