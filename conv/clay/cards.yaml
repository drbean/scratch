  \item [Family Relationships] After Frank died, she got married again. This third person with whom she had a relationship died last year.
  \indent The children from the first relationship and the son she had with Frank are now grown up.
  \indent She is now caring for her brother, who cannot dress himself or use the restroom himself. Her mother, who is now dead, had been caring for him before. For a while she was caring for both her brother and sick husband.
  \item [Black families] 
    The percentage of single-parent families among blacks is higher than the percentage in the general population. We may be surprised that Frank and Rebia split up, but we are less surprised when we know they are black. The percentage of black men who are involved in crime is also higher than it is in the general population.
  \item [Work and Union Activity] 
    She doesn't really have a job. She is getting money from the state government for the 'job' of looking after her brother, but it is not very much. She is poor.
    \indent She belongs to a workers' union. She went to Washington, DC for the union to tell US Congress about the need for money that people like her have. She also spoke out against plans by the state government to cut money for welfare programs for people like her.

  \item [First years] She met Frank Mixon when she was pregnant. Frank went up to her and told her she was going to become his wife. Then they got married. They didn't have any money. He wanted to give her his school ring, but she didn't want to put it on.
  \item [Married life] He finally bought her an engagement and a wedding ring. He was very kind to her and to the children she had from the earlier relationship. The son she had with him was also gentle. The elder children regard Frank as their real father.
  \item [Separation] Frank and Rebia separated. Rebia doesn't say why they separated. She doesn't know much about how he died but she says that he was helping a woman and the boyfried of the woman shot him in the back. We don't know what Frank was trying to do.
