<h2>Be truthful</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not tell your partner what is not true. If you have information that A is 18 years old, do not say that A is 80.
<li>Don't make up anwers to tell your partner. If you do not know how old A is don't say A is 18 or A is around 18.
<li>If your partner asks you a question, to which you know the answer, tell him/her the answer.
</ul>

<h2>Be informative</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give your partner all the information that you have that is necessary for him/her to understand the situation as you understand it. If you think that A is young and you think that A's age is important, say you think A is young.
<li>Don't give your partner more information than he/she wants or needs.
<li>You must try to think how much your partner understands of what you are saying. Perhaps your partner can or cannot understand what you are saying.
</ul>

<h2>Be relevant</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Stay on the topic. Don't start talking about a different topic, like the weather, or where your partner comes from, or what he/she did on the weekend. Stick to the topic on the cards.
<li>Some of the information on the cards may not be relevant to your partner's question. You don't have to tell your partner that information, even though you think it may be important. Answer the question your partner asked.
<li>Some of the information on the cards may not be important. Don't tell your partner unimportant things.`
