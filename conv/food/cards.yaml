        \item [Solutions] These problems can make overweight people avoid socializing. But the best thing is to seek out social situations that take the mind off weight.

        \item [Bodies] come in different shapes and sizes. The best weight for you is the one right for your body size.
        \item [Inheritance] plays a big part in determining size and weight. Big-boned people weigh more than thinner people. 2 people of the same height with different weights can still both be the right weight.
        \item [Being overweight] can also be result of poor eating and exercise habits that also run in families, but which are not inherited.
        \item [Exercise] just 3 times a day, for 10 minutes each, can make a difference, if you are overweight. But exercise is a good idea, even if you are underweight. Building stronger muscles can increase your weight.
