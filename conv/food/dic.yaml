    Father: When we opened the restaurant we really didn't know what we were doing. We had some pots and pans from the house and I never cooked anything until we opened that restaurant. I said to myself, my gosh, I don't know how to cook, do I? But I did. And I didn't realize I knew. I learned by watching my grandmother and my mother, and now you're doing it.

    Son: Now we're feeding a thousand people a week.

    Father: Yeah, amazing, isn't it? That's a lot of pasta.

    Son: I never realized before I started working with you, you sure knew how to drew the line between son and employee. And I mean I can remember when I was the first dishwasher at Spano's ..

    Son: .. and I was wondering, why do I have to be the dishwasher?  

    Father: Yeah. I'm the son, I'm supposed to be the executive.  

    Son: Right, I didn't think I was supposed to be the dishwasher.

    Father: You wanted to be president.

    Son: Right. I did. I wanted to walk in, I wanted to wear a shirt and tie my first day on the job.

    Father: But you also saw your dad washing dishes too at that same sink.

    Son: I don't know if you knew early on that I was going to want to do this forever. I don't know if that was part of it and you were trying to teach me or if you were just doing it because that's way it's supposed to be.

    Father: No, we were trying to teach you a work ethic; whether you were in a restaurant business or not, I think we did a heck of a job.

    Son: Right, but it wasn't until started doing it for myself that I realized, okay, this is why they did it the way they did it.

    Father: Yeah, well, you know, they say the older you get, the smarter your parents get.

    Son: Yeah, I'm real - now I know. Just this past Friday night, my dishwasher got sick and the guys in the kitchen were busy and I took my coat off and I took my tie off and I put an apron on and I started scrubbing dishes. And I mean the guys in the kitchen, they were amazed.

    Son: I guess they had never seen the owner scrubbing dishes before.

    Father: What do you like about the restaurant business? It's not easy, is it?

    Son: No, but if I hit the lottery tomorrow and never had to work another day in my life, I would not close the restaurant down.

    Father: Um-hum.

    Son: Because, you can have all the money in the world, but if you don't do something that has any meaning, I mean, what's the point? When somebody's plate comes back completely empty, that's instant gratification. Or they were starving to death, one of the two, and that makes it all worthwhile. There's no other job like that. You know, at least every day I can make somebody happy.

     Everybody got something in their life that they're good at. This is what I do good--I eat. I was always a bigger eater than most people in my family and about five years ago there was an ad in the paper for a matzo ball contest. I went down to the contest. I broke a record; I ate ten matzo balls, half-pounders the size of baseballs, in two minutes, fifty seconds. No one ever ate more than ten. And I went on to the finals and I won. And Mayor Giuliani gave me the trophy, and the announcer said, "Let's hear it for Don Lerman and Rudy Giuliani." And we were both shaking hands like the president and the vice president-elect. That was the first trophy, the matzo ball trophy, ever in my life.

     I always wanted to be famous. I always wanted to be president or a big lawyer or a doctor or something, and it just never happened. I had a couple of day-old bread stores; that was my business. I worked eighty hours a week, seven days a week. I just thought, you know, the parade would pass me by until the eating. My father never lived to see me famous and he always thought I was a loser, you know, but I wish he was alive to see that I'm a somebody.

     Tyson: I was a 13-pound baby at birth. By the time I was 6 years old, I was weighing over 100 pounds. When I was nine, I weighed 250 pounds. When I was 15, I weighed 329 pounds. And the only place I could weigh would be to go to old Baptist Hospital and then weigh on those freight scales. And I didn't know how to work the scales. I always had to get somebody help, and then they go and rush to tell everybody come and look here.

     It was a sight when you see a 300-pound teenager, particularly when I came along ...

     Tyson: It was a sight when you see a 300-pound teenager, particularly when I came along, because I'm a child of the Great Depression.

     Fleming: How do you think your size affected your personality, too?

     Tyson: Oh, yeah. It's hard to describe how you feel. You feel so insecure. And everybody, for most part, is laughing. And then I tried to grin and bear it. But it was just such a painful experience. And in the elementary grades, I don't think I had a teacher that I could truthfully say was just unkind. But you could tell how they felt when there were little things to be done ...

     Tyson: And in the elementary grades, I don't think I had a teacher that I could truthfully say was just unkind. But you could tell how they felt when there were little things to be done like maybe going to another teacher's room and getting a glass of water. You were just kind of left alone. And you have to be extremely heavy before you understand what a painful situation it is. And I really believe it helps me to establish an empathy with most any problem that people have that keeps them from being able to accept themselves as they'd like to.

     Fleming: Well, can I ask you, what are you most proud of in your life?

     Tyson: Let me put it like this: if you're wise, you accept life whatever it presents and make the best of it unless you want to go nuts. I accepted whatever came. Some of it was pleasant. Some of it was not. But I think the fact that I was able to accept it and move on and do as well as I did is the thing that I'm proudest of.

    Lynch: When I first met Antonio, he was 270 pounds.

    Douglas: I always have been kind of a bad eater. If it didn't move, I ate it; and if it moved too slow, I ate it.

    Lynch: So, one day, I says, look, Antonio, I'd be really embarrassed if an old guy like me could run faster than you can. He was so anxious to get back at me he challenged me to this race. I says, okay, I'll take you up on that. But I tell you what, this race isn't going to be on this car wash lot. What we need to do is we need to go out and rent a small stadium.

    Douglas: I had on a tank top that represented NAACP and he had one representing his people - the AARP.

    Lynch: Unfortunately for him, in the first race he was beaten.

    Douglas: I had never ran a 100 meters in my life. Wasn't no way I was going to beat him.

    Lynch: After the race, I gave him a big hug, you know, and I said, it was amazing what you've done. Everybody's so proud of him. So, we had a subsequent race the following year. And the second race he's been in the gym for 12 months and he's been psyched up by his son, who's telling him what an embarrassment it is for him that his father get whipped by a geriatric guy like me. And guess what? He won the second race. There was only one person in the stadium that was happier than Antonio, and that was me.

    Douglas: Over the years, I think I've learned more from him than any one individual I have met. I don't know where I'd be without him. I just thank God for him.

    Lynch: I think that Antonio Douglas has been one of the important things in my life. Somebody I've been really proud to be associated with and I love him.

    With my father I was terrified. I don't remember one incident of ever having sat on his lap, or being held, or hugged, or loved, or told that I was beautiful or wonderful. I was told I was overweight but as I looked at pictures recently, I was not overweight. Everyone would have ice cream for dessert but I was given a half a grapefruit. My father, he was the one who weighed me. He would say, Looks to me as if you've gained some weight - tomorrow morning we'll weigh you. And I stayed up all night worrying about being weighed, and that's when my struggles with food started.  And here I am: 81 years old and it's still going on.
