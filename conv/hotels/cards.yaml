      A: You were working but had a mental breakdown. Thirty years ago, Ed Trinka told you about the Sunshine. You have been living in a cubicle there ever since. Most of the tenants are dysfunctional, like Max, the drug addict, but Nathan, the manager is a nice guy and makes the hotel bearable.
      B: You are the manager of the Sunshine. Your wife left you and you lost you job at a bank after you were injured. You have been there since, but not as long as Eddie. The people make you feel sad, but you feel good about helping to give them a home.
      C: You are an architect, but you have left your family and friends and your job. You just want to be by yourself and take drugs. You know what you are doing is disgusting, but you enjoy doing it. The police come and arrest you. After, Nathan cleans up your room for the next tenant.
      D: When you were working as doorman in front of the Plaza, alcoholics and others walking past sometimes asked you for help finding a cheap hotel. You always gave them Nathan's name and the Sunshine's address. You would never stay there yourself. Everyone there is an addict or dysfunctional.
