      \item [Timing] Woman are not ready to talk about the adoption when they want to talk about it, or when circumstances force them to talk.
      \item [Circumstances] Every woman has a different story to tell. The circumstances of every adoption are different. And women tell their stories to different people. They know some of these people well, because they are friends and family. Others they don't know well. And every one of their listeners has different ideas about adoption. Some people don't approve of what they did. 
      \item [Considerations]
      \indent What words does the woman use: 'relinquished my child for adoption,' 'placed my child for adoption,' 'gave up my child,' or 'share my child with another family?'\\

      \begin{description}
      \item [Diary] Terri kept a diary for 6 months after the adoption of her daughter. Unlike Deborah's parents, the parents who adopted Terri's child sent Terri emails and pictures in a new 'open' style of adoption.
      \item [Relationships] Terri talks to a lot of women who gave their children up for adoption. This makes her feel better. However, she also feels depressed and sometimes cries.
      \item [Telling others] She sends her diary to friends and asks what they thinks. She wants to show pictures of her daughter to her family but they don't want to look at them.
      \item [Media attention] She uses her diary for a book she is writing (she is a writer) and appears on TV to talk about giving up her baby. Then she gets more baby pictures and she feels guilty and lost.
      \item [Events] She feels new and alive when her dog won't let her stop playing. She feels her daughter is lucky. Then she meets her daughter and adoptive parents. She is happy and then sad. 
      \item [The end] She talks about the adoption without being ashamed. She is ashamed of herself but not ashamed of the adoption.
