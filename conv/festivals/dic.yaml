    I was in first grade. And I was at the bus stop. And Chrissie Urban told me that there was no Santa Claus. And my gut reaction was, I punched her right in the face. And I ran home. And I told my mother, 'Mommy, Chrissie Urban just said there's no Santa Claus. What a liar she is. And I don't even want to go to school, 'cause I'm so upset.' And. ha, ha. All I remember is, getting so upset that Chrissie Urban told me that.

    Christmas was huge.

    We had this myth that Santa Claus decorated our tree, so .. So the older kids had, anyone who knew that Santa Claus wasn't real, would stay up and decorate the tree. And we always put the tinsel on, one strand at a time. And we'd take a box of powder Tide, mix enough water to just make it pastey, and then just take our fingers and slide it over every branch on the tree, so that it looked like a snow blizzard had just plopped all the snow down. And it really made the tree special.

    In 1944, my brother Joe was in the service. Of course, he was fighting in Germany. A telegram came saying that he was missing in action.
    And so, I was afraid to tell my parents and I ran to get my three sisters who were at church. And I said you have to come home, Momma and Papa need you.
    We were so upset, my sister, instead of getting in the car, she ran home, ran all the way home alongside the car. It was the worst news you could get.
    It was getting closer to Christmas and Mother says, We won't be able to have a Christmas tree this year, because Joey's not here. We don't know if he is alive.

    We don't know anything. So we're going to not have a Christmas tree.
    And then Christmas Eve, a letter came from Joey. I'm in a hospital, I'm all right, I'll come home soon, and by now you must be putting up the Christmas tree.
    And my mother says, Oh, look what happened. He's telling us to decorate the tree.
    And my brother John, he says: Mom, guess what? Last night when I came home from work, I got a Christmas tree, and I put it under the porch, because I thought maybe you would change your mind and we could have the Christmas tree.
    So we put it up and decorated it. This one's for you Joe.
    And it turned out nice.

  - Continental NORAD Region Holiday Greeting

    Voice-over: For nearly 60 years, the North American Aerospace Defense Command has tracked jolly old Saint Nick as he makes his December 24th trek around the world, delivering toys to children across the globe. In 2014, the Continental US NORAD Region, along with the 601st Air Operation Center, America's AOC, are proud to continue this age-old tradition.

    McCardell: You know, this will be the 59th year we've been tracking Santa. It really does bring the season alive. And I enjoy being one of Santa's elves for a day.

    Linda: My son, Dennis Junior and I have been tracking Santa with NORAD for 17 years. Yes, that's right. 17 years. We still remember the first time we called. It is for real. It is serious business.

    Dunning: You know, my two boys, [..] and [..], really enjoy following Santa on NORAD's radars. They also enjoy the games, one of our favorite family traditions.

    Kellum: As I get ready this Christmas tree, it reminds me of a time a few years ago, when my daughter and I were getting ready for Christmas. On Christmas Eve, she asked where Santa was and I told her that we were tracking Santa. I pulled up the NORAD tracking center on the website and showed her that he was in South America and it was time for her to go to bed. She happily jumped into bed and was ready for Santa the next day.

    Man: It's that time of year again for NORAD to track Santa. We're looking forward to it in my house. My kids have promised to be good. I don't know if it will happen, but miracles have happened before.

    Ellison: Daddy, who watches Santa when he flies all around the world?

    Voice-over: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the men and women of CONR and America's AOC defend the skies over the continental United States. By utilizing two air defense sectors in the Eastern and Western United States, as well as alert sites across the country, CONR and America's AOC are responsible for detecting, deterring, defending and if necessary, defeating any aviation threat to the citizens of the United States and US critical infrastructure.

    But on December 24th, we take on an extra-special mission of tracking Santa and his reindeer as they fly over the skies of North America.

    First man: Hey folks, I need an update. Santa's big flight is right around the corner. Do we have an update I can give the general?

    Woman: Yes, sir. Actually, we're expecting blizzard conditions in the Pacific Northwest. However, this will not affect Santa's flight on December 24th.

    First man: OK, thanks for the weather update. Anything on the tankers?

    Second Man: Sir, we have four tankers on alert, standing by to support Santa's mission.

    First man: OK, great. Anything for the fighters.

    Third man: Sir, ...
