      A:  You are a woman and a pastor at the First Baptist Church. You are 92, but you are still active in the church. In particular, you help Scott at his annual Thanksgiving dinner for people who do not have family to share Thanksgiving dinner with. You take people without transport to the church and say a prayer before people start to eat the Thanksgiving meal.
      B: You are a member of the First Baptist Church, in Melrose, Massachusetts, but your family is on the other side of the country. So you go to Scott's Thanksgiving dinner every year, because Thanksgiving is a time to be with family. You do not have a car, so Veronica (Ronnie) gives you a ride to the church in the church's van. 
      C: You are the senior pastor at the First Baptist Church, Like Veronica, you are a woman. Baptist churches have not always welcomed woman pastors. But your church appreciates the work you do for it. You appreciate the work Veronica does and the Thanksgiving dinners Scott has put on for the last 25 years at the church.
      D: You are not a regular attender at the First Baptist Church, and Thanksgiving is a secular festival, rather than a religious one, but putting your dinner on at the church seems appropriate to you. It's no problem to you that the church is headed by Damaris, a woman. You get on well with her. You also welcome Lonnie, who comes each year to the dinner.
