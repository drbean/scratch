    Dimasi: When did you decide to give me up for adoption.
    Adam: Well, I was in my final year of university, and I wasn't in a serious relationship with anyone. It was kind of a fluke. You know they say it only takes once. And it turned out to be true. And it was probably the loneliest time of my entire life. When I was in the hospital, I was there for hours by myself. And then they took you away, and they wouldn't allow me to see you. But one of the nurses took pity on me and brought you in to my room in the middle of the night one night so that I could count fingers and toes.

    Adam: But then the other, uhm, practice was that in the case of adoption, I had to actually carry you out of the hospital and hand you to the doctor, physically. That was supposed to be an indication of my willingness to give up the child. And, that was hard.
    Dimasi: I want you to know that I never was angry. I never resented your decision. I've never had reason to. I knew that I was adopted, and my parents always made it a positive part of my life, that they picked me, that they really wanted me. And I just remember your being a question mark. That part of who I was was just a question mark. And I got to a point in my early twenties when I was just so curious ...

    Dimasi: And I asked my parents if they had, you know, any legal papers or, or hospital papers. And my father took me upstairs and gave me a pile of papers, and that's when I discovered the hospital bill that had your name on it.
    Adam: Mmh-hmm.
    Dimasi: On all the other papers, your name was blacked out with a magic marker. But there was this one for, like, aspirin.
    Adam: Ha, ha, ha.
    Dimasi: It was the most inconsequential bill, but there was your name, and it was the first moment that you as a person were concrete to me.
    Adam: Mmh.
    Dimasi: And it knocked me down.
    Adam: I remember that first phone call that we had. You had left me a message.

    Adam: So I had your voice on my machine and I kept listening to it over and over and over again, 'cause it just had never crossed my mind that I would ever hear your voice. I  think it was at least midnight by the time I called you, maybe later. And we talked for two or three hours, it just seemed so easy. We haven't shut up much since.
    Dimasi: No.  
    Adam: Ha, ha, ha.
    Dimasi: That's true.
    Dimasi: When I describe our relationship to people, I say that you're more like a mentor than a mother. You're a person that I turn to for advice and someone that I enjoy talking to about all the things that I'm passionate about.
    Adam: I'm really grateful. I love you.
    Dimasi: I love you too.

    "Shepard: I woke up the morning after I got to Glasgow and I decided to just go to the university to look around, see what I thought. I had the address written down for my biological father and I went there.

    I looked down the hallway and I saw a sign with his name. Finally, I just said this is probably the only chance in my life I will ever have to do this.

    Walked up to the door and knocked. He looked at me with a look that was not quite hostile, but impatient. I said, Do you have a minute? He said, Sure. And I said, Do you remember living in Connecticut 20 years ago. And he got this kind of odd smile on his face and said, Yes, I remember it.

    I said, Well, do you remember a relationship with a woman named Eloise, that you had? And he says, Yes, yes I do.

    And I says, Well, uhm, I'm the result of that relationship, And he says, Aaaaaah.

    Walks over towards me, and I have this panic that he's going to touch me. But he doesn't. He walks past me and he closes the door and walks back and sits down at the table where I'm seated, and says, So, you're here.

    And I said, Yeh. And I told him that I had three questions that I wanted to ask him. He said, Sure. And I said, First, I want to know if there is any history of diseases or things that I needed to be aware of, genetically, just to get that baseline out of the way. And, he said, No, not that I know of.

    And then I asked him if he would be willing to just explain a little the circumstances surrounding my birth, and how it came to be that I was born and he left. And for the first time and only time over the course of our fifteen-minute conversation, the grin left his face. And eventually, he said, Well, I think that at that point, Eloise was ready to have a child. And I said, And you were't. And he laughed, and said, No. Never was, never have been, He didn't really offer me anything more.

    Ryan: Did you ask your third question?

    Shepard: Yeh, I looked at him for a minute, and then I asked my third question, May I take a picture of you? I had a little disposable camera, took a picture of him, and, um, that was that.

    It ended with me, saying, Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. And I said, Goodbye, and he turned to walk back towards his computer, and he says, Goodbye for now.

    I don't know if I'll ever contact him, if I will ever want him to be a part of my life in any way. But for now, I don't.

    And, so, I walked back through this park in Glasgow back towards this place where I was staying and I felt that I had made a peace with a part of myself that I never expected, that I never even thought possible."
