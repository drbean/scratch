        \begin{normalsize}Facts about single parents\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Definition] Single parents are parents who care for one or more children without the assistance of the other parent.
        \item [Background] The living arrangements of single parents are of many different types. Some live with family or other adults.
        \item [Statistics] In the US, around 12.9 million, or 9 percent of all, families are  headed by a single-parent, 80 percent of them by a female. An example is the families of US Presidents Clinton and Obama for at least part of their lives.
        \item [Effects] Single parent families are more likely to be poor, and on average single mothers have poorer health than other mothers. \\
        Single parenting has some negative results for children. However while the effects exist, the size of the effects and the actual numbers of children affected are not that big. Most children from single parent families do well. \\
        Factors which influence how children develop in single-parent families include the parent's age, education, and occupation; the family's income and support network of friends and extended family members.

        \begin{normalsize}Nick Shepard, and his parents' story\end{normalsize}
        \normalsize
        \begin{description}
        \item [Upbringing] We don't know how Nick was brought up. He may have been brought up in a single-parent family. Or his mother might have had a relationship with someone else, like Rebia did with her husband, Frank Mixon. He only learned his biological father's name when he was 19, so perhaps he wasn't aware that the father he had wasn't his 'real' father until that time.
        \item [Eloise and Nick's father's relationship] Nick's biological father doesn't really explain why he and Eloise split up. The birth of Nick seems to have been a factor. He says Eloise was ready to have a child, but that he wasn't. He gives the impression that he ended the relationship by leaving. Whether this is true or not is not clear.
        \item [Nick and Nick's father's relationship] It appears Nick's father is now more willing for their relationship to continue than Nick is. Nick says, for now, he doesn't want him to be part of his life. His father says, Goodbye, for now. This seems to imply he would be willing to see him again.

        \item [Different family problems] Some children are given up by single unmarried woman. Other children are given up by, or \ul{taken away from}, families in trouble.
        \item [Saving families] 40 years ago, social welfare agencies in the US started to think that trying to help families that were breaking up to get together again was a good idea. They thought it was better for the children to be reunited with their families than to be adopted.
        \item [Foster care] While social workers tried to solve the families' problems, the children were held in foster care, and weren't allowed to be adopted.
