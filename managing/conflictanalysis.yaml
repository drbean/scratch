    Nigel Nicholson has some advice for managers. It is to listen very carefully and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. This is good advice for the manager of the Muller and Peterson sales teams. The Muller-Peterson sales manager should listen carefully and try to get the two teams to find things they both agree about, like family, respect, and the wish to do a good job. The manager should also talk to members in each team and try to find people in each team who don't agree with the rest of their team, and try to get them to talk to members of the other team.
    Nicholson's advice also applies to Charles, the chief executive of the camping equipment company, where Todd and Oliver are fighting. Charles should talk to Todd and Oliver and find points where they both agree and try to get them to understand each other's ideas and point of view.

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen and ask good questions, so that you can understand motivation. His advice for Todd, the sales manager at the camping equipment manufacturer, would be to try to understand Oliver better. Todd needs to think about why Oliver wants to be a very good salesman. Todd is American, but Oliver is French. They have many things in common. Do they think differently about marketing because they come from different countries?
    Nigel Nicholson's advice for the manager of the old Peterson sales team, who is now the assistant manager of both teams is to try to understand his (or her) own motivation. The assistant manager thinks the old team has a positive attitude and its efficiency and good customer service is important. Why doesn't he (or she) think the same about the Muller team? Did this person really listen to the ideas of the Muller sales team and ask questions to try to understand them?

    Nigel Nicholson's advice is to listen to people and to ask good questions, so that you can understand their motivation. The Muller sales team and Oliver, the super salesman think similarly. They both think that selling is the most important thing a business does. They both think selling the product is more important than producing the product. So when customers ask for an early delivery date, they both promise early dates, even though they don't know whether the company can deliver by that date. 
    Nicholson advice's to Oliver and the Muller sales team would be to stand back and look at the bigger picture. They need to understand that the company is a system and they need to cooperate with all parts of the system for it to work at its best. And they shouldn't keep information to themselves. They should share it with all the other members of the company so everyone understands the system.
  D: |
    Nicholson's advice is to stand back and look at the bigger picture. He wants people to realize that what they are doing is part of a system. The Peterson sales team understands it is part of a system. It understands the business is a system where all parts depend on each other. And it understands the company and its customers also form a system. So it thinks it's important to share information with other people in the company. And it realizes that customers will trust the company if they are happy with it. So it tries to build good relationships with customers. 
    But Nicholson wonders if the Peterson sales team understands how important it is to the company. It is perhaps the most important part of the system. It drives the company, because it is the way the company comes in contact with other systems, that is, customers. And the success of the company depends on these contacts with customers.

  identifier: Nicholson's advice
  A: Nicholson says the manager needs to help the two different teams find ways in which they agree, for example, about concern for family, the need for respect, the desire to do a good job. On the basis of this agreement they can start to agree about how to work together as one sales team, too. Important people to lead this process are people who disagree with their own team.
  B: Nicholson advises managers who support one team rather than the other team to examine their own and the other people's motivation. Todd needs to understand why Oliver wants to be a super salesman. He also needs to understand the real reason he wants to control Oliver. The old Peterson sales manager needs to understand the real reason he (or she) supports the Peterson team.
  C: Nicholson thinks Oliver and the Muller sales team aren't able to see the big picture. They are just thinking about selling the product and they don't think about production of the product. They probably don't realize that the company is a system, where everyone needs to cooperate and everyone needs to have all the information available, so that the system works well.
  D: Nicholson thinks the Peterson sales team understands the big picture. It understands it is part of the company, which is a system. It also understands the company is part of a larger system with its customers. He thinks it may not realize it is the most important part of the company. Contact with larger systems through customers determines the success of the company.
