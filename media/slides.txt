The dog didn't find on West Coast. The dog WAS found.

The car didn't return. The car WAS returned.

## Headline tense. No past tense. Present tense.

Man USES banana.

Singer TRIES to kiss reporter.

Tension is built by keeping back the most important word until the end of the line.

Headline: Da de da de da. Boom!

## Good lead paragraph, bad lead paragraph

- The polar bear can endure the cold, because it has a strong body.
- A polar bear was discovered in a home in Alaska. It maybe was hungry.

## Good headlines, bad headlines

- Bank robber waited for police to arrest him

- one day

## Indefinite/definite articles in lead

## Dr Bean's keywords are not headlines.

Take note: Shine, Oscar, Sherry

- Headlines should have a verb.
- The same verb will be used again as the main verb in the first sentence.

Good/bad lead paragraphs
