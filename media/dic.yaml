    "00:57 Local fans of New York Nicks star, Jeremy Lin, defied the rain in Taipei today to get their hands on the first official Linsanity T-shirts made available here in Taiwan. Hundreds of people lined up outside an Adidas store before the limited-edition shirts went on sale at 11am. 

    Some members of the crowds were students. They said they had taken time off school to buy one of the two hundred and fifty shirts.
    
    Two high school students, who were first in line, said they claimed their spot at 7 am.
    
    Each customer was allowed to purchase only one T-shirt, which cost one thousand and ninety NT.
    
    A separate blue "Linsanity" Adidas T-shirt will hit the stores on March the second, when ten thousand T-shirts of both editions will be made available."

    "00:28 You all know that in July of last year there was a very widespread perception that the phone hacking at the News of the World was much more extensive than just two rogue reporters who'd been jailed. And that the Metropolitan Police Service may not have investigated these concerns thoroughly enough.
    Uhm, as has been said, the then Commissioner asked me to do this work. The then Commissioner and and, Assistant Commissioner, as you know, then resigned. Uh, there've been a lot of allegations that senior officers, including them, had been too close to the News of the World, in accepting inappropriate hospitality.
    So what was the job that they asked me to do. Uh, to look at the ethical issues arising from the relationship between the police and the media. To look at what should be the proper purpose of the relationship between the police and the media. What ought to be done to improve public confidence in the relationship between the police and the media, which by that time had taken a severe knocking. And what hospitality is appropriate for police to accept or to give the media.
    What did I do to try and understand the issues? I had discussions with 137 people. A lot of police and police staff within the Met. A lot of journalists, editors, business people, politicians, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and the Inspectorate. Uh, if you want to know who I actually saw, there's a list at the back of my report.
    So what problems did this piece of work were demonstrated or told to me by those people. There was extensive, there is extensive, contact between the media and the Met. And much of it is fine and healthy and straightforward. But there was a lack of transparency and inadequate control in, which led to information being given out which should not have been given out. And in my view, as I'll come on to say, information which ought to have been given out, not being given out.
    There's no doubt that influence and favor played a part in the issues that had arisen. And, in my view, played a part in what ought to be an unbiased and independent relationship of the police with the media. In my view, it did jeopardize the Met's independence. And I got quite a lot of criticism from journalists that access was biased towards certain publications, and some journalists who were, particularly journalists who were scrutinizing the Met, weren't given the same access as others who were seen as friends of the Met.
    So what were the problems that were thrown up? Well, there was quite a lot of disclosure for improper advantage.

    O'Reilly: OK. Sanctuary cities, what do you think?
    Rivera: I think you have the story almost exactly wrong, my friend. I think that we're talking about drunk driving. And you know, there were 347 drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the year 2005. I think this may be the first drunk driving story we've done from Virginia. And the only reason it's news on "The Factor" is because the driver was an illegal alien. What if his name was Bubba? What if his name was Buddy? What if his name was Bobby?
    O'Reilly: Not the same story. Not the same story.
    Rivera: It's not the same story, but still you know, my heart goes out to those parents.
    O'Reilly: I hope so.
    Rivera: But, really it does. But there were 17,000 families that suffered the way those parents have.
    O'Reilly: Yes?
    Rivera: It's not an illegal alien story, Bill. It's a drunk driving story. And I think you owe ..
    O'Reilly: Here's where you're wrong.
    Rivera: .. the mayor an apology. She doesn't enforce immigration policy.
    O'Reilly: She has set up the system in her city, knowingly, that says the police ..
    Rivera: Don't feed me that. What's his name, Lou Dobbs.
    O'Reilly: You listen. Listen to me.
    Rivera: He has regenerated his dead career on the backs of illegal aliens. Let's not go there.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: The Minutemen are wearing guns now on the border.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: What they going to do. Start shooting illegal aliens?
    O'Reilly: When you enter this country illegally, Number One, you have no right to be here. No right. That's the truth.

    2:22
    Rivera: It could be a Jewish drunk. It could be a Polish drunk.
    O'Reilly: But this guy didn't have to be here.
    Rivera: It could be an Irish drunk.
    O'Reilly: No.
    Rivera: It could be an Italian drunk. What the hell difference does it make?
    O'Reilly: It makes plenty of difference!
    Rivera: It does not, Bill.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be here!
    Rivera: He didn't commit a felony.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be in this country!
    Rivera: What - but that has nothing to do with the fact that he was a drunk!
    O'Reilly: Yes, it does! He should have been deported! He should have been deported! And this mayor and the police chief didn't deport him!
    Rivera: Listen, do you know how many people we have in jail? How many of them are illegal aliens? Illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens do. They do.
    O'Reilly: This guy shouldn't have been here.
    Rivera: Cool your jets. It has nothing to do with illegal aliens. It has to do with drunk driving.
    Rivera: Don't obscure a tragedy to make a cheap political point.
    O'Reilly: If I'm the father ..
    Rivera: It's a cheap political point!
    O'Reilly: No, it isn't.
    Rivera: And you know it!
    O'Reilly: This is justice.
    Rivera: This has nothing to do with that poor old lady mayor.
    O'Reilly: And you want anarchy.
    Rivera: Has nothing to do with that mayor.
    O'Reilly: No. You want anarchy. You want open-border anarchy.
    Rivera: No. What I want ..
    
    3:50
    Rivera: But to take this tragedy in Virginia Beach, and make it about illegal aliens ..
    O'Reilly: It is.
    Rivera:  .. is a sin. That is a sin.
    O'Reilly: Bull. This family lured no one. This family lost their daughter.
    Rivera: Three hundred and forty-seven drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans.
    Rivera: Do we care about them?
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans that way. And I deal with it all the time.

    "A Georgetown University co-ed told Representative Nancy Pelosi's hearing that the women in her law school program are having so much sex they're going broke buying birth control pills.

    "Speaking at a hearing held by Pelosi to tout Obama's mandate that virtually every health insurance plan cover the full cost of contraception and abortion-inducing products, Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke said that it's too expensive to have sex in law school without mandated insurance coverage.

    "Apparently, four out of every ten co-eds are having so much sex that it's hard to make ends meet if they have to pay for their own contraception, said Sandra Fluke's research."

    Can you imagine if you were her parents, how proud of Sandra Fluke you would be? Your daughter goes up to a Congressional hearing conducted by the botox-filled Nancy Pelosi and testifies she's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them. Or the Pope.

    "Forty percent of the female students at Georgtown Law reported to us", said Sandra Fluke, "that they struggled financially as a result of this policy." The policy is Georgetown University's student insurance doesn't cover contraception. It costs a female student $3000.00 to have protected sex over the course of her three year stint in law school, according to the calculations. "Without insurance coverage, contraception as you know can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school," Fluke told the hearing. $3,000 for birth control in three years, that's a $1000 a year for sex and she wants us to pay for it.

    All of this just since January 7. Just since January 7. You guys who are thinking you're not going to go to college, let me just say one thing to you: Georgetown. They're admitting before a Congressional committee they're having so much sex they can't afford the birth control pills. That's all you've got to come up with. And all of this is the Republicans' fault.

    Susan Fluke, Fluke, one of the Butt Sisters being dragged out of law school by the hair. Wait 'til Rick Santorum hears about this.  Wait 'til Gingrich hears about this. What do you think he'll do. They'll put a stop to this right away. They'll head over to that university. They'll stop it. They'll spy on Susan Fluke and interrupt her in mid-coitus. And then they'll make them get married. Make 'em get married and make 'em have those babies, and make 'em have 10,000 babies and then stay home. Listening to the Troglodytes by the Jimmy Castor Bunch.

    What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex? What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us. We're the pimps, the johns. That's right. We will be the johns.

    No! We're not the johns. Well, err. That's right.  Pimp's not the right word. Ok, so she's not a slut. She's round-heeled, I take it back.

    Howard Stern: Because it's true about Jay. Jay had to sell Doritos. I mean, it's so true about him. Like he had enough money. It's like, when I see guys on radio who make good money, like fucking, fat Rush Limbaugh, selling on his website, every piece of shit, including Excellence In Broadcasting chair to his audience. Yeh, OK. Like some guy might say to me, Hey, what's wrong with that. If people want an Excellence In Broadcasting chair, why shouldn't Rush sell it. Because Rush makes enough money. Like you don't have to be a whore for everything.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, you understand Jackie selling his cups.
    Howard Stern: Right.
    Robin Quivers: Because he needs the money.
    Howard Stern: Right. Yeah, I know. When he was on our show, he was making a lot of money. 
    Robin Quivers: I'm talking about now.
    Howard Stern: Now he's got to sell a cup. He's one step from holding out a cup in the street. But the fact of the matter is that, you know, I see guys, like Rush Limbaugh, who supposedly has a house in Palm Beach.
    Robin Quivers: He's got a plane.
    Howard Stern: He's got his own private plane. He's looking to buy a football team. And he's still got to sell you his Excellence In Broadcasting key chains.
    Man: He's got it. He's loaded.
    Howard Stern: How about giving those dittoheads a key chain for free, you know.
    Robin Quivers: If you need somebody to be carrying around your emblem, give it to them.
    How Stern: And we are in show business, so there are certain things you have to sell. Like, for example, this service. I mean, it's not going to survive if there aren't subscribers. And there are things that you do sell. Maybe you write a book. Maybe not. I don't, I don't begrudge Rush Limbaugh
    Robin Quivers: How did he get into the chair business?
    Howard Stern: That's what I mean. I mean, why not just make .. He has Rush Limbaugh ties, I think. 
    Robin Quivers: Yes, He does. I think so.
    Howard Stern: Neckties, because look so spiffy. And don't sell the audience everything. You're not in the necktie business.

    01:24: Howard Stern: Okay. So let me explain something to you. The state of Hawaii, when someone is born, they don't issue a birth certificate. They issue a certificate that proves birth. But it's an abbreviated version. In other words, Obama didn't make this up. He didn't say, "I'm the only guy who was ever born in Hawaii who's going to have this abbreviated birth certificate. It's a birth certificate. It's legal. The man has been able to work. He's been able to carry on his life, having this birth certificate. It isn't the full birth certificate. This is what they issued everyone. Anyone born the same year as Obama got the same fucking thing. Everyone. So, why, if you have a half a brain, and you've got any kind of IQ or time on your hands, would you sit there and question it? In other words, what do you think, he got an abbreviated birth certificate on his own? He's the only guy who's ever born in Hawaii. Everyone who was born in Hawaii has the same stupid thing.
    Robin Quivers: Well, the whole idea is that Hawaii would go into collusion with him because they wanted a president from their state.
    Scott Depace: You're missing the point.
    Howard Stern: No, no. I haven't. I heard your point on the air. Here's .. I'll address your point. So he becomes president. And he hears .. Like if I became president, and I heard people saying, Well I don't believe Howard Stern was born in the United States, I wouldn't even pay attention to it. I'd be like, What, what the fuck are you talking about? And then, I'd go on and be the president.
    Scott Depace: It wasn't just a couple people saying it. They were passing laws in states that said he was going to have to produce it. It's huge.
    Howard Stern: Scott, this is ridiculous as anything. You don't .. If you're the president of the United States, and you're worried about A. I hope today I wake up, I hope, uh, I hope the economy doesn't crash. B. I hope I don't get assassinated.
    Scott Depace: You're wrong. You're so wrong. Howard, This thing was taken care of. Apparently, this thing was ..
    ...
    Howard Stern:  You know how many people believe in this country that we didn't land on the moon? So the president knows this. And he goes, How am I going to prove to those wack fucks out there that we did land on the moon.
    Scott Depace: Well apparently he did. 
    Howard Stern: How am I going to do it? How am I going to prove it to them. He didn't wake up saying, I'm going to prove to every conspiracy jerk-off, A. where I was born, B. that we landed on the moon. Like these imbeciles don't think Osama bin Laden's dead. Our military, God bless our military. I'll tell you why they're so smart. And why our president is smart. They took this ratfuck and threw him right in the ocean. Now, I'll tell you what. It alleviates all problems. You, do you know the nonsense that would be going on with these shitheads we're at war with if the body was still around? If it was laying somewhere. They would be carrying on. They would be like children tantruming. We wouldn't be able to stop the tantruming.
    Robin Quivers: It would be a call to action.
    Howard Stern: They took that body. They dumped it right in the fucking ocean. They aren't worried about whether you believe he is dead or not. The president didn't wake up and say, Oh, Donald Trump's going to tell me I didn't really kill Osama bin Laden.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, the same people who've been questioning my birth certificate will question this.
    Howard Stern: You don't worry about that.
    Scott Depace: Now could I have a minute.
    Howard Stern: No. Yes. A minute with you is torture to me.
    Scott Depace: Well, you know what.
    Howard Stern: It's like waterboarding. It's like you're waterboarding when you talk. 
    Scott Depace: I need to get my own show.
    Howard Stern: You've got to get your own show. Because I heard you on the wrap-up show.
    Scott Depace: Listen, Howard. This happened before he became president. For one, it was questioned. Two, apparently he was able to ..
    Howard Stern. Scott, do you think the president cared?
    ...
    Scott Depace: Do you understand the significance of this, though. Imagine if he was not from this country, and he passed all these laws. Everything would have been null and void.
    Howard Stern: Ha, ha, ha, ha! You're a pisser. He's got a birth certificate.
    Scott Depace: Well, now he's got one. He showed it now.
    Howard Stern: He had it all along. They showed the thing that every citizen who's born in the United States in Hawaii gets. We landed on the moon. 
    Scott Depace: It's pretty simple to prove ...
    Howard Stern. You're out of your mind. My, you're out of your fucking mind. You should jump in the ocean with those ..
    Scott Depace: He should have done it, and it wouldn't have been a problem. I tell you, Right away.
    Scott Depace: Thank you. 
    Howard Stern. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in God?
    Scott Depace: Yes, I do.
    Howard Stern: Why? You can't see him. How do you know he's there?
    Scott Depace: It's called faith.
    Howard Stern: You have faith. Well, have faith the president is from the United States. Get out of here. Right now. Have faith. He has faith. Have faith in your president. Get out of here. You don't have faith? Well, guess what? He got the job done.

    00:25: O'Reilly: Right, Stern, you can't be serious, can you.
    Stern: Look at you.
    O'Reilly: 500 million bucks. That's what I have here. I don't believe it, but 500 million bucks. This Sirius operation is going to pay you in five years. Is that right?
    Stern: Well, first of all. I'm worth every penny.
    O'Reilly: But, is that right? Is it 500 million.
    Stern: No, it's not exactly right.
    O'Reilly: It's close.
    Stern: I don't talk about my salary.
    O'Reilly: I understand.
    Stern: Because if I try to hire a plumber, I can't get one to come to my house, because they think I'm walking around with 500 million dollars.
    O'Reilly: But this is in the ballpark. 500 million.
    Stern: No, it's not in the ballpark. I'm not making 500 milllion. But I'm making a lot of money.
    O'Reilly: Okay. But it's you and your operation. You're paying your corporation. You're paying your corporation.
    Stern: Right.
    O'Reilly: Between 80 and 100 million a year.
    Stern: Listen to you. You're so jealous. That's why you sell all those tchotchkes every night at the end of the show. 
    O'Reilly: You want to get that out of the way, up top?
    Stern: You want to do the tchotchkes later? Or you want to do it now?
    O'Reilly: Let's do it later.
    Stern: All right. But, you've got a good answer. You do it for charity, so it's ,, that's enough.
    O'Reilly: You already know that. Your informers tipped you off. But, I got a couple of beefs with you about it. But, we'll ...
    Stern: You know what happened to me since I came into this building? And then we'll get to the tough stuff.
    O'Reilly: No, we don't really have time for that.
    Stern: You don't care.
    O'Reilly: No. I don't care what happened to you. I know you were in the makeup chair for a long time. And it's obvious why.
    Stern: Well, I need makeup, because I said, You, you are the Brad Pitt of this channel. And to really sit here with Bill O'Reilly and try to look good next to this handsome man, I said, You'd better put a lot of makeup on me. And I'm sitting there and while I'm in the chair, Geraldo comes waltzing in.
    O'Reilly: Talk about handsome man, huh?
    Stern: Yuh. And I said, Geraldo? First of all, you don't even recognize him. He's got five pounds of makeup caked on him. He's beet red.
    O'Reilly: He's 80 years old. Give him a break.
    Stern: He's got to be. He's got a four-year-old wife and he's got a one-year-old at home. I said, What are you doing? ...
    O'Reilly: But look at your hair. Every curl is manufactured. It's terrific. And you're a radio guy. You're not even on TV.
    Stern: I am on TV. I'm on On Demand. And I was on E! for eleven years. As the number one show on E!.
    O'Reilly: Yeh, it was exciting. You and Joan Rivers. I couldn't get enough of that. OK. So you make a lot.
    Stern: Go ahead. I may be. Does that surprise you? I'm probably the most ..
    O'Reilly: No, but I want to get to the economics of this. So 80 and 100 million a year go into your corporation. You go on Sirius, the satellite radio channel, okay. How are they going to make a profit? I mean, how many people you think are going to go over and .. What are they, 50 bucks for that thing, the subscription?
    Stern: No, is it my problem if they make a profit? Is that my worry? They paid me to go there and entertain the people and that's what I'll do. And they shall come. Umm, what I've heard so far is that when I got there, they had 600,000 subscribers. And lo and behold, it's been a year later, now. And I've been, certainly, it's been in the news that I'm going to satellite. They are now estimating 3.1 million people have joined.
    O'Reilly: And how much is it a year to do ..
    Stern: It's twelve dollars a month for a radio subscription. And I think it's the best ... If you want to get into this, I think it's the best buy in town.
    O'Reilly: All right. So, if they ...
    Stern: Are you going to let me explain?
    O'Reilly: .. get a couple of million, then they can make money off ...
    Stern: Sure. Of course, they're going to make money. Satellite radio, it's inevitable. Because, uh, FM and AM radio have been so regulated, so overly-commercialized. Because the content has been so watered down. Uh, guys like me who make people laugh in the morning and appeal to millions of people can't do our act any more. And guess what's happening. Satellite radio will succeed. Much like cable television, which you're on, has succeeded. Because you can program ..
    O'Reilly: But Fox has succeeded, but MSNBC's a disaster. So it's not a lock. But, I'm glad you gave me the segue.
    Stern: Trust me. With me, it's a lock.
    O'Reilly: Okay. We'll see. What are you going to do differently? Are you going to curse every two minutes? Is that what you're going to do?
    Stern: No, I think you know better than that. And you better calm down. Sit back in your chair.
    O'Reilly: No, I'm okay. I'm relaxed.
    Stern: Because I'll smack you around. You know that.
    O'Reilly: That'd be good because my lawyer, Swifty is right over there.
    Stern: I would take you right out.
    O'Reilly: And I would take a lot of that 100 million.
    Stern: Go ahead, baby. It's all yours. No, but, but, in all seriousness, what was your question again?
    O'Reilly: You see? Are you going to curse every two minutes? What are you going to do?

  - media

    Wallace: Who is Bill O'Reilly? Is he a patriot? A blowhard? A braggard? A bully? Well, it turns out there's a lot more to him than any of that. Since we sat down in 2004, he's maintained his domination of cable news. Competitors have tried to copy him. And four nights a week, in perhaps the ultimate flattery. Steven Colbert parodies him on Comedy Central. But we found the man, talking about himself, full of surprises. And he began with one.
    O'Reilly: You know, you're responsible for this O'Reilly deal. And I always tell everybody, You've got a problem with me, you call Mike Wallace. He's responsible for the O'Reilly deal.
    Wallace: What are you talking about?
    O'Reilly: When I was growing up, I didn't care about the news at all. I had no interest in the news. But my father liked you.
    Wallace: You serious about this?
    O'Reilly: No sir, I'm serious about everything. Okay? And I said, That guy, he's pretty interesting. Because he's giving people a hard time. Which is what you did. So then when I got older, and I said, There were three guys that I watched, you, Howard Cosell, This is Howard Cosell. Loved him. My father hated him. And Tom Snyder. Because Snyder knew how to work that camera. You were the three. So, you're responsible. Howard's dead. You can't blame him. But you're still here. So, if you don't like me. you go to Wallace.
    Wallace: Incidentally, let me interrupt. Your wife has told you, Don't point, at Mike.
    O'Reilly: Yup, that was the advice I was given.
    Wallace: But you keep pointing.
    O'Reilly: I know. But I can't, I can't stop.
    Wallace: Go ahead.
    Voice-over: He does do a lot of finger-pointing. [Dialogue with Michael Moore] On his nightly Fox news program, the O'Reilly Factor. [Dialogue with Michael Moore]
    Wallace: You enjoy the arguing. You enjoy tackling what you call justice. You enjoy taking on people on your show.
    O'Reilly: Sure. It's a battle of wits. Who's the quicker draw, intellectually. I enjoy the joust. And I think people enjoy watching the joust and it's one of the reasons we're real successful.
    Voice-over: The O'Reilly Factor is the highest-rated hour on any cable news channel. He told us that over twenty million people a week watch the show. But there are millions more who hear him on radio stations. He's a syndicated columnist, and a best-selling author. All made possible by the enormous success of his cable show. [Factor announcement] The concept was simple enough. Bring the op-ed page to television. [O'Reilly opinion statement] The Factor is all about opinions, O'Reilly's opinions. This about the leaders of Iran. [O'Reilly opinion statement] The Factor formula works. It's made him incredibly popular. And incredibly unpopular too.
    Wallace: When I tell people I'm going to do a profile of O'Reilly. Oh, wonderful, wonderful. Don't let him off the hook. Go get him. Bring him down. You're the guy who can do it.
    O'Reilly: Why? Why do they want me to be brought down? Why?
    Wallace: You could answer your own question.
    O'Reilly: I can't. I don't know who you hang around with. I suspect they're pinheads, but I don't know for sure.
    Voice-over: People tell us they dislike him because of encounters like these. [O'Reilly arguing with 3 people]
    Wallace: That's not an interview. That's a lecture.
    O'Reilly: Oh, I lecture. Well, I'm a commentator. We went back and did research on the last six years of the Factor. You know how many times I told people to shut up? Six. Three times in anger. And three times, just, hey, doing a shut up about things. My program ..
    Wallace: Three times.
    O'Reilly: My house. No, no, no. It's not a free country. My house. You're disrespectful in my house, you're putting things out there that are defamatory in my house, you're going to get taken to the cleaner.
    Voice-over: And outside his house is no different. On Tim Russert's cable show, O'Reilly was paired with New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. [Argument with Paul Krugman] But his most notorious encounter developed at a book fair when he took on humorist Al Franken about a book Franken wrote saying O'Reilly had lied publically on a number of occasions. And used a splotchy picture of him on the cover. [Argument with Al Franken] Their very public battle was about a number of things, one of which was that O'Reilly had said he was an independent. Franken showed he had registered Republican.
    Wallace: What upsets you so, that when Al Franken calls you a liar, and proves it.
    O'Reilly: Proves it. Bull.
    Wallace: Shall I give you book, chapter and verse?
    O'Reilly: Why bother? It's a character assassin. Why lower yourself to that kind of a discourse.
    Wallace: Why does it get you so upset?
    O'Reilly: Because it's dishonest. It's parasitical. And it's character assassination. Why wouldn't I get upset.
    Wallace: But right or wrong, O'Reilly likes to get upset. When O'Reilly was raised Irish Catholic, in Long Island, New York. the son of a middle-class accountant, he said his dad was an under-achiever, who came to blows with him as a teen-ager. But his dad made him scrappy, which has served him well in his career. First though, he had to work his way through college, painting houses.
    O'Reilly: Painting houses taught me something. I didn't want to paint houses.
    Voice-over: His first job in TV was in a small-market Scranton, Pennsylvania.
    O'Reilly: Not like Maria Shriver. Though, the respect to her, nice woman. Who started in Los Angeles. Why? Because her name was Maria Shriver. O'Reilly starts in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with the coal miners. I loved it. My folks. 
    Wallace: Give me a break. Why are you comparing yourself, all of a sudden, with Maria Shriver.
    O'Reilly: Because I'm telling you that this road I took had to be taken. There was no other way to do it.
    Voice-over: For the record, Maria Shriver started in Philadelphia as a low-level assistant. As for O'Reilly? His career took off in 1996, when the fledgling Fox News Channel bought into his idea for a high-energy op-ed TV show. [O'Reilly's first Fox broadcast] And by 1998, it was a bona-fide hit. Must-see TV for the conservative right. [O'Reilly at Republican convention] The old boys' club there welcomed him with open arms. [O'Reilly at Republican convention] Some folks would expect this reception for Bill O'Reilly, a favorite of conservatives. But what you don't expect ..

  - Young Mike Wallace interviews quiz kid

    Wallace: Good evening... tonight as a special pre Christmas program, we go after the story of a child prodigy, one of the biggest money winners in television quiz show history. He's twelve-year-old Lennie Ross, the California school boy who won a total of one hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars on The Big Surprise and The Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Challenge with his amazing knowledge of the stock market.

    Wallace: Lennie, in a moment I shall ask you what you think of quiz shows, egg-heads, President Eisenhower, American education and Santa Claus. My name is Mike Wallace, the cigarette is Philip Morris.

    Commercial: Philip Morris. The natural smoke with a man's kind of mildness presents the Mike Wallace Interview.

    Wallace: We'll talk with Lennie Ross in just a minute. I'll bet there are smokers in your Christmas list who would welcome a gift carton like this. This handsome package of today's Philip Morris contains 200 smokes, with a man's kind of mildness. Two hundred smokes that taste just right. Because you see, there's a straight forward character to this cigarette. And yet there's mildness here too. Genuine mildness. No filter, no fooling. No artificial mildness. And that's the reason I like today's Philip Morris. That's why I'll be giving cartons of Philip Morris like this one. And I hope you will too. And during the holidays, if company's coming to your house, it might be a good idea to have some smokes on hand for them to enjoy. So pick up a few extra cartons. I'm sure any smoker will appreciate the man's kind of mildness in this cigarette. Today's Philip Morris.

    Wallace: And now to our story. In recent years, America has found a new set of heroes, quiz contestants like Teddy Nadler, Charles Van Doren and twelve-year-old Lennie Ross, and now that Russian Sputniks are whirling above our heads, it's generally agreed that America needs more youngsters like young Leonard Ross. Tonight we'll try to find out what he thinks of his problems and of ours. Lennie, first of all, let me ask you this, you've made a hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars answering questions, how does it feel to be doing it for free?

    Ross: I think I enjoy it. uh... I wouldn't tell until the end of the program before I can say for sure.

    Wallace: All right, I'll ask you that question again later. Last week, Lennie, the United Press asked one of the original radio Quiz Kids, actress Vanessa Brown, why she refused to appear on TV Quiz Shows and she said, "Because I want to be an actress, not an oddity. To appear on a quiz show -- she said -- there's no trick to it at all, it's a matter of collecting and saving facts like some people collect money." How do you feel about that?

    Ross: Well, quiz shows are entertainment like the Mike Wallace Interview and I certainly a lot of the questions asked deal with facts which are not too useful, but not everything is useful. Certainly there... a number of things that a person acquires are material things and information, which have no actual use and I think the quiz show is an entertainment based on the fact that some people have accumulated a specialized knowledge of a subject.

    Wallace: You don't feel, then, that you were a freak or an oddity when you answered stock market questions that might've stopped -stumped, as a matter of fact did stump, veteran stock brokers. You didn't feel like a...

    You've heard so many stories about my father this week. Here's one you haven't heard. Three summers ago, Caroline Wallace, then aged one, went to Martha's Vineyard to visit her great-grandfather. Here she is, literally taking the first step of her life reaching out to him. This week, when she learned he had passed away, Caroline, who is now four. drew this picture of her favorite stuffed bunny, herself, and her great grandpa. And she dictated this message for him, to her teacher. 'I love you. I miss you because I wanted to say goodbye.' And then she signed it.

    Back in 2005, when my father was 87, he had just written a book. He came on Fox News Sunday to talk about that, and all sorts of things.

    Chris: Do you understand why some people feel such disaffection for the mainstream media?
    Mike: Oh, yeah, yeah. They think we're wild-eyed commies, liberals. Yes?
    Chris: That's what they think. And how do you plea?
    Mike: I think it's damn foolishness. First of all, they're patriots. Just as much as any conservative. Even a liberal reporter is a patriot. Wants the best for this country. And people, you know, your 'Fair and Balanced' friends at Fox don't fully understand that.
    Chris: All right. Let's talk about the book.
    Mike: Yes.
    Chris: Because what's amazing is all the people you have interviewed over the years. In the case of the Middle East, everyone from Menachem Begin to Anwar Sadat. From the Shah of Iran to the Ayatollah Khomeini.
    Mike: 'He calls you, Imam--forgive me, his words, not mine--a lunatic.'
    Chris: Now, when you say, 'Forgive me,' to a Middle East leader, does that mean you're about to drop the hammer?
    Mike: Frequently, frequently, that's exactly right.
    Chris: Someone once said about you, that Mike Wallace has an underdeveloped sense of other people's privacy. And as your son, I'm here to testify it's absolutely true.
    Mike: Really?
    Chris: Yes. Ah, I want to ..
    Mike: What have I revealed about you that upsets you.
    Chris: Well, no, but I want to show you something. A few clips from interviews that you have done with celebrities over the years. Take a look.
    Mike: 'You really believe in extra-terrestrials? Do they come visit you on the porch? Now you're being unpleasant, Wallace, is what you're saying.'
    Shirley MacLaine: Yes, this is what I was a little afraid of. But you don't have to be that unpleasant. It doesn't become you.'
    Johnny Carson: I stopped doing jokes immediately, as soon as people found out that he was an alcoholic.
    Mike: Of course, it takes one to know one.
    Johnny Carson: Oh. Cruel. You're cruel.
    Chris: Why do you, why do you do that?
    Mike: Why do I do what?
    Chris: Why do you sit there and say, It takes one to know one?
    Mike: He's a drunk.
    Chris: Or why do you say to Barbara Streisand on national television, 'You know what your mother says, You don't have time for anyone?'
    Mike: These are interesting questions. Why are you asking? Because they're interesting questions.
    Chris: Do you ever say to yourself, I'm going to embarrass them, I'm going to hurt his feelings?
    Mike: No, no. I don't have subpoena powers. They know who I am when they come on. They know the kind of questions that I ask all my ... Actually, I didn't start really asking questions until I was 38 years old. But, and I had to do certain things. I remember before, before we lost your brother, I used to, you know, do all kinds of ..
    Chris: Commercials. Cigarette commercials. Send me to college.
    Mike: That's correct. And I used to say, I've got to raise the kids. Therefore, I'll do whatever I have to do. And after we lost Peter, I said, I can't hide behind that anymore. And what I'm going to do is, in the memory of your brother, your older brother, Peter, I'm going to do something that I am proud of doing and that he would be proud to have me do.
    Chris: As you look over the whole career, all the places you've gone, all the people you've met, what do you make of it? I mean, what do you make of Myron Leon Wallace, from Brookline Massachusetts, having had this extraordinary journey?
    Mike: It is extraordinary. It is just, sometimes I can't believe it. Can you imagine talking to Eleanor Roosevelt back in 1957? This extraordinary woman.
    Chris: I want to ask you a question, that in the book, and I didn't realize you'd ever asked it, but that you asked Thomas Hart Benton, the great artist, in 1973. And you asked him, and I'm asking you, Do you hate getting old?
    Mike: Well, I'll tell you what. I had my hearing aids fixed today, so that I could properly hear you. I can't see as well. I used to be able to play tennis. I now have--this has stopped me from smoking--a pacemaker, have for about the last 15 years. Yeh, I don't like getting old.
    Chris: And you don't retire because?
    Mike: Because I love .. It is not work that I do. I love what I do. When I get up in the morning, and I think, I am going to have the opportunity to .. I wasn't that happy about waking up this morning.
    Chris: I felt the same way. All right. Finally, I have another idea for a target for your next interview. And the question is: What would you like to ask this fellow?
    Voice-over: October the 30th. William's 3-week birthday.
    Chris: What would you like to ask him?
    Mike: He's a good-looking kid, isn't he?
    Chris: Yes. He takes after his mother.
    Mike: That's right. He does.
    Chris: You've never seen this tape.
    Mike: No, I've never seen this .. I have the still. He moves around. That's a nice surprise. Bless you.
    Chris: Well, it's a great book. It is a great life. I couldn't be prouder of both. And I love you.
    Mike: I love you. And I'm proud of you.
    Chris: After we ran that interview, I said, There's no crying on Sunday morning talk shows. Well, there have been lots of tears this week, along with lots of laughs, and some wonderful stories. Our family has really held on to each other tightly. Over the last two decades, my father became my best friend. He was so interesting, so much fun to be around. And, yes, sometimes, so exasperating. I didn't get into reporting, at least, consciously, because of him. But we used to get such joy from sharing experiences with each other. So many times this week, I've wanted to ask him what he thinks about all the coverage of his life. And then I stopped, and remembered he's not here. That is going to take some getting used to. I can't imagine life without him. We'll see you, next Fox News Sunday.

    Tapper: 00:12 Good morning, everyone. George Stephanopoulos has a well-deserved morning off. We're exactly six months from Election Day. And in case you had any doubt, the presidential campaign is officially in full swing, with President Obama holding his first two re-election rallies yesterday in the critical battleground states of Ohio and Virginia.

    The president was a wee bit rusty at first, nearly forgetting his wife Michelle as he walked off Air Force One in Columbus. Oh, there she is. And after that, the first lady introduced him at Ohio State.

    Michelle Obama: We just cannot turn back now, right? We have come so far, but we have so much more to do.

    Tapper: And then the president stepped up and made his pitch.

    Obama: If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them it's still about hope. You tell them it's still about change.

    Tapper: And let's now bring in the president's chief campaign strategist, David Axelrod. David, thanks for joining us.

    Axelrod: Sure. Good to be with you, Jake.

    Tapper: The president kicked off his campaign in Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia. And here are the headlines in the newspapers that greeted him, which were reporting on Friday's jobs report. The Columbus Dispatch: Job numbers don't mirror hope. The Richmond Times-Dispatch: April job growth slight. Portion of Americans in labor force falls to lowest level since 1981.

    The headlines say it all, don't they? The economy just isn't strong enough. And what the president has been able to accomplish has not been enough.

    Axelrod: Well, Jake, let's consider where we were when the president took office. We were losing 800,000 jobs in one month. We lost 4 million in the six months before he took office, or nearly 4 million. In the last 26 months, we've gained 4.2 million private-sector jobs. The last 6 months, we've gained nearly 200,000 jobs a month.

    And you have to look at the trend, not one month, or short periods of time. Now we have a lot of headwinds. The president said yesterday, we have to be vigilant. We have to be persistent. We've got headwinds from Europe, and the Middle East, and so on. But we have to push forward and Congress can help. The president has offered a series of ideas on small business tax cuts, real small business tax cuts on helping people refinance their mortgages. Take advantage of low interest rates. On getting a surface transportation bill done. All of these will help our economy move forward. But we can't .. what we can't do is go back to doing what we were doing before the crisis, because that'll result in the same disastrous outcome for our economy and the middle class.

    Tapper: And David, when the president gave his speech yesterday, he acknowledged that people are still hurting. Let's take a look.

    Obama: The real question, the question that will actually make a difference in your life and in the lives of your children is not just about how we're doing today. It's about how we'll be doing tomorrow.

    Tapper: David, it seems as though the president is acknowledging that he cannot win on the premise, Are you better off than you were four years ago. Doesn't that in itself suggest failure?

    Axelrod: No. As I said Jake, we've come a long way from what we were. We're in the middle of recovering from this recession. But there's a larger project, which is, how do we rebuild this economy in the long-term so the middle class is growing and not shrinking and people who work hard can get ahead, people who act responsibly are rewarded for that responsibility? That's what we're working on.

    And what we can't do is what Governor Romney has suggested, which is to go back to the same formula that -- that hurt our economy and hurt so many people, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that we can't afford, cutting Wall Street loose to make its own rules. That is not a prescription for the kind of growth that we need in this country. 

    And by the way, I would note that in 2004, when the recovery from that recession was more laggered than what we have today, Governor Romney ran around this country saying that President Bush ought not to be blamed for that and it was just politics to blame him for that. I suggest it's just politics when you hear Governor Romney today, and he certainly wants to go back to that same disastrous formula. 

    Tapper: One of the issues that you guys are going to be facing, one of the headwinds is the lack of enthusiasm, or at least less enthusiasm. When I covered you guys, your campaign in 2007, 2008, you would -- you and your staff members would excitedly regale us with the huge numbers of crowds, crowd estimates. At OSU, at Ohio State yesterday, in a stadium that seats about 18,000, there were roughly 14,000 people there. Now, granted, those 14,000 were very excited. They supported the president. But there were still more than 4,000 empty seats. Doesn't that indicate that there is a problem you're facing when it comes to fewer people who are excited about the president? 
  
    Axelrod: Jake, you should have gone along on the whole trip. In Virginia, there was an overflow crowd. And that's the way it is. But the fact is that 14,000 is 11,000 more than the largest crowd that Mitt Romney has ever drawn.

    So I think there's enthusiasm for the president's candidacy. And, you know, we've got tremendous volunteer response. Just from that event, we got thousands of more volunteers in our campaign. I am certain that we are going to have an enthused volunteer core and enthused electorate out there.

    The thing that we've seen over time is that Republican enthusiasm has dropped precipitously, partly because what we've seen from Governor Romney is all negative. Ninety percent of the ads that he's run in this campaign, $55 million of advertising, 90 percent of it he and his team have run have been negative. His attacks, his speeches now are entirely negative attacks on the president, doesn't talk about his own record, doesn't really talk about his vision. 
  
    That is not going to create enthusiasm. I think what the president's talking about will create enthusiasm, which is, how do we build an economy in which the middle class has a shot, everybody gets a fair shake, everybody has some confidence that their kids might do better in the future? That's the project we're working on.
