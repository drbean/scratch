    "00:57 Local fans of New York Nicks star, Jeremy Lin, defied the rain in Taipei today to get their hands on the first official Linsanity T-shirts made available here in Taiwan. Hundreds of people lined up outside an Adidas store before the limited-edition shirts went on sale at 11am. 

    Some members of the crowds were students. They said they had taken time off school to buy one of the two hundred and fifty shirts.
    
    Two high school students, who were first in line, said they claimed their spot at 7 am.
    
    Each customer was allowed to purchase only one T-shirt, which cost one thousand and ninety NT.
    
    A separate blue "Linsanity" Adidas T-shirt will hit the stores on March the second, when ten thousand T-shirts of both editions will be made available."

    "00:28 You all know that in July of last year there was a very widespread perception that the phone hacking at the News of the World was much more extensive than just two rogue reporters who'd been jailed. And that the Metropolitan Police Service may not have investigated these concerns thoroughly enough.
    Uhm, as has been said, the then Commissioner asked me to do this work. The then Commissioner and and, Assistant Commissioner, as you know, then resigned. Uh, there've been a lot of allegations that senior officers, including them, had been too close to the News of the World, in accepting inappropriate hospitality.
    So what was the job that they asked me to do. Uh, to look at the ethical issues arising from the relationship between the police and the media. To look at what should be the proper purpose of the relationship between the police and the media. What ought to be done to improve public confidence in the relationship between the police and the media, which by that time had taken a severe knocking. And what hospitality is appropriate for police to accept or to give the media.
    What did I do to try and understand the issues? I had discussions with 137 people. A lot of police and police staff within the Met. A lot of journalists, editors, business people, politicians, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and the Inspectorate. Uh, if you want to know who I actually saw, there's a list at the back of my report.
    So what problems did this piece of work were demonstrated or told to me by those people. There was extensive, there is extensive, contact between the media and the Met. And much of it is fine and healthy and straightforward. But there was a lack of transparency and inadequate control in, which led to information being given out which should not have been given out. And in my view, as I'll come on to say, information which ought to have been given out, not being given out.
    There's no doubt that influence and favor played a part in the issues that had arisen. And, in my view, played a part in what ought to be an unbiased and independent relationship of the police with the media. In my view, it did jeopardize the Met's independence. And I got quite a lot of criticism from journalists that access was biased towards certain publications, and some journalists who were, particularly journalists who were scrutinizing the Met, weren't given the same access as others who were seen as friends of the Met.
    So what were the problems that were thrown up? Well, there was quite a lot of disclosure for improper advantage.

    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  Former News Corp employees Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson and six other defendants are now on trial for hacking the phone of missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002. Milly was later found dead. The hacking, which her parents interpreted as Milly using the phone, gave them false hope and scandalized the nation. Here's from the BBC:

      [CLIP]:
    
    CORRESPONDENT:  The defendants are lined up in order of the charges, some accused of phone hacking, some of paying public officials for stories and some of hiding evidence from the police, Mrs. Brooks, with all three.
    
     [END CLIP]
    
    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  To recap, Brooks and Coulson were editors for the now defunct News of the World tabloid, once a tent pole of Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The hacking scandal has shaken Murdoch's empire like an earthquake, causing parts to break off and others to crumble. However, the notable American properties, Fox TV and Fox News Channel and the Wall Street Journal continue to thrive. And the New York Post isn't going anywhere.
    
     
    
    NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik's new book, Murdoch's World:  The Last of the Old Media Empires, dives into the intricacies of Murdoch's holdings and character, and he finds that they contain multitudes.
    
    DAVID FOLKENFLIK:  And he's certainly a conservative, no doubt, but he's also a pragmatist, and he sees ways he can do business from people from the center left, like Hillary Clinton, when she was running for Senate in New York in 2000 and 2006, like Tony Blair in the UK. Tony Blair flew to a small island off Australia to indicate that he would show deference. Similarly, when there was the question of would the UK join the euro, the common currency of Europe, which Tony Blair very much championed as an idea, Murdoch was dead set against it. Blair didn't change his policy but what he did do is he says, I'll put it to a public vote. So he set a major obstacle in his own path, as a way of showing Murdoch that he would take his concerns into account.
    
    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  Let's do a rundown of some of your scoops, David. Start with the attempts by the chiefs at the now-Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal to muzzle coverage of the News of the World's hacking scandal. Reporters at the Wall Street Journal determined that reporters at the News Of the World had messed with their own coverage to protect themselves but the people at the top of the Journal were trying to squelch it.
    
    DAVID FOLKENFLIK:  Absolutely. You know, about a half-dozen times, Robert Thomson, the handpicked chief news executive at the Wall Street Journal, a fellow Australian, essentially a surrogate son to Rupert Murdoch, he tried to kill it. And then at a certain point he kept raising the bar on what they would have to publish.
    
    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  Mm-hmm.
    
    DAVID FOLKENFLIK:  The headline that would have been in the first paragraph was pushed way down to the ninth paragraph. It was softened. It is to the Wall Street Journal's credit that a story that was damaging the Rupert Murdoch business interests in UK in 2011 got in the newspaper so prominently. But it's not to the credit of Robert Thomson. He chose basically protecting his mentor over protecting the newspaper's integrity at a pivotal moment.
    
    ...

    [7:20]

    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  I have always said that Murdoch cares much more about the health of his business than he does about any political position. But then I think, well, maybe he just loves this kind of crazy showmanship journalism. Is it all about ink? I'm just spinning my wheels in the hamster cage, 'cause I can't come up with a moral to this story.
    
    DAVID FOLKENFLIK:  Well he gave a talk in 1989 in Britain at a very prestigious lecture series in which he said, a public service is any service that you can provide, within the law, that the public is willing to pay for. And his tabloids absorb that to such a degree that over the decades they dropped the "within the law" part and they said, whatever the public is willing to pay for is a public service. When you lose the "within the law" part of that equation that Murdoch set out in '89, suddenly the lines between right and wrong become almost invisible.
    
    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  David, thank you very much.
    
    DAVID FOLKENFLIK:  No, thank you, Brooke.
    
    BROOKE GLADSTONE:  David Folkenflik's book is called, Murdoch's World:  The Last of the Old Media Empires.

    Robinson: A media analyst, quoted earlier this year in the New York Times: Quote, Rupert has his mojo back.
    Murdoch: [Snort]
    Robinson: Rupert Murdoch, on Uncommon Knowledge, now.
    Robinson: Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge, on the Wall Street Journal dot com. I'm Peter Robinson. When his father died unexpectedly, Rupert Murdoch, then 22, inherited an afternoon newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, The News. Some six decades later, Mr Murdoch serves as chairman and chief executive officer of the company for which the Adelaide News served as the foundation, the News Corporation, overseeing media properties now on five continents, including the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, the New York Post, and Twentieth Century Fox, the Los Angeles film studio, where this interview is taking place. Rupert Murdoch, welcome.
    Murdoch: Thank you, Peter.
    Robinson: Segment one. The new News Corporation. You announced last spring that you intend to split The News Corporation in two. One company, which will continue to be called the News Corporation, will be devoted to publishing. It'll hold HarperCollins, the book publisher, and your newspapers. The other company, which will be called the Fox Group, will be devoted to entertainment. You spent your life, building the News Corporation. Why split it in two.
    Murdoch: Basically, it is very interesting. To start with, I resisted the idea for a long time. But what it has led to is really better and more intensive management of all these assets. And, instead of just thinking, Well, there's a lot of money coming in from cable television, and we can keep the newspapers--It wasn't as bad as that, but we really, uh ... Now in this new company, looking at the whole business model of newspapers: what we can do, what digital developments we can make. It's, it's a great opportunity.
    Robinson: The Economist magazine. Quote, investors so distrusted the mogul's devotion to unprofitable newspapers--everybody knows you love newspapers--that for years a "Murdoch discount" has dogged the company's share price. So that's the pressure from the market that you are referring to.
    Murdoch: Yes.
    Robinson: The markets wanted you out. Newspapers: unprofitable. Why do you want to be in that business?
    Murdoch: Oh, I think they can be a great force for good, still. And do a lot of things, and I think, you know, they've just got to change their business model. And that's what we're about. We're thinking about that, very hard and in fact, working on it and going forward. You know, if the advertising is in a decline--and it is, it has declined--a lot of it, like small [unintelligible], I don't think will come back. We have to look to our readers to pay us more. So we have to give them better products. We have to have digital versions, which we charge for properly. Maybe start also some new things, which will be tied into newspaper apps.
    Robinson: Alright. Now, preparing for this interview, I live up in Silicon Valley, as you know. I asked a number of friends what they would do with your newspapers if they were in your position. And those friends said, sell them.
    Murdoch: Ha-ha.
    Robinson: Fast. You've got a situation now, in which advertising revenues have declined, but the rate of decline has slowed. So for some number of years newspapers will provide a modest but reliable source of cash, effectively coupons. And the reason for selling them now was because private equity companies with the economy in uncertain shape are sitting on a lot of cash. This is the perfect moment to sell those dogs. Get rid of them. There's no real growth in them. So what I'm trying to get, is whether you won't sell them because you so love them. You said earlier, you can do a lot of good with them. And it is an important fact in understanding your life that one grandfather was a preacher.
    Murdoch: [Laughs] Yes.
    Robinson: You do feel, you do feel a duty to do good with what you own.
    Murdoch: Oh, absolutely.
    Robinson: Or do you say or do you say, Whoa, whoa, whoa. The market is wrong. I've been in this newspaper business all my life. I see opportunities the market is missing.
    Murdoch: Well I think both. I do see opportunities. But we'll see how it develops. And how we go, but we've got people working on all our newspapers and they're really enthusiastic about the future. It's great. But you know, it is difficult. The economies we operate in. Less so here perhaps, although I'm not optimistic. But very difficult in Australia and in Britain. That affects circulations. And we're moving more and more to a subscription model as we have here with the Wall Street Journal, ..
    Robinson: I see.
    Murdoch: Where well over ninety percent are subscriptions paid for by credit card every month. Just as really every newspaper in America is.
    Robinson: While we're still on newspapers. One success story and one not so successful story. You mention the Wall Street Journal. You bought that paper in 2007, circulation about two million.
    Murdoch:  That included the digital side, yes, right.
    Robinson: Circulation today, just about flat. But, by comparison with the other members of the ten top circulation newspapers in the country, maintaining a flat circulation represents an enormous triumph. Nine of the others, nine of the ten others all have dropped circulation. The New York Times over the same period since 2010 is down circulation twenty percent. So the News Corporation purchases the Wall Street Journal. And the Wall Street Journal does something no other major newspaper in the country does which is to hold its own in a very tough climate. How did you pull that off?
    Murdoch: Well I had a brilliant editor. I've got to really to give him the credit for it. Robert Thompson, who incidentally will be the chief executive of the new publishing company.
    Robinson: The new News Corporation.
    Murdoch: The new News Corporation, yes. And, he's gathering a team around him. But, he really did it. Slowly turned it around. Turned the staff. Changed a few people. And then introduced new sections. I mean, you look at when we bought it. They'd just started the Saturday edition. And everyone was very divided on whether this was a waste of money, a mistake, or not. We've made it far the best read. We've added sections, really distinguished book reviews.
    Robinson: Book reviews, Washington coverage.
    Murdoch: And leisure activities. We're all off duty. So it's something for everybody there.

nineteen ninety six and CNN's relative readings from MSNBC is relative readings of ... the puzzle to me is everything Fox News does that those in public ... there were no secrets about how you ... how you do when Fox News does it does it on ...

    O'Reilly: OK. Sanctuary cities, what do you think?
    Rivera: I think you have the story almost exactly wrong, my friend. I think that we're talking about drunk driving. And you know, there were 347 drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the year 2005. I think this may be the first drunk driving story we've done from Virginia. And the only reason it's news on "The Factor" is because the driver was an illegal alien. What if his name was Bubba? What if his name was Buddy? What if his name was Bobby?
    O'Reilly: Not the same story. Not the same story.
    Rivera: It's not the same story, but still you know, my heart goes out to those parents.
    O'Reilly: I hope so.
    Rivera: But, really it does. But there were 17,000 families that suffered the way those parents have.
    O'Reilly: Yes?
    Rivera: It's not an illegal alien story, Bill. It's a drunk driving story. And I think you owe ..
    O'Reilly: Here's where you're wrong.
    Rivera: .. the mayor an apology. She doesn't enforce immigration policy.
    O'Reilly: She has set up the system in her city, knowingly, that says the police ..
    Rivera: Don't feed that, don't feed that--what's his name, Lou Dobbs--Lou Dobbs mob.
    O'Reilly: You listen. Listen to me.
    Rivera: He has regenerated his dead career on the backs of illegal aliens. Let's not go there.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: The Minutemen are wearing guns now on the border.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: What they going to do. Start shooting illegal aliens?
    O'Reilly: When you enter this country illegally, Number One, you have no right to be here. No right. That's the truth.

    2:22
    Rivera: It could be a Jewish drunk. It could be a Polish drunk.
    O'Reilly: But this guy didn't have to be here.
    Rivera: It could be an Irish drunk.
    O'Reilly: No.
    Rivera: It could be an Italian drunk. What the hell difference does it make?
    O'Reilly: It makes plenty of difference!
    Rivera: It does not, Bill.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be here!
    Rivera: He didn't commit a felony.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be in this country!
    Rivera: What - but that has nothing to do with the fact that he was a drunk!
    O'Reilly: Yes, it does! He should have been deported! He should have been deported! And this mayor and the police chief didn't deport him!
    Rivera: Listen, do you know how many people we have in jail? How many of them are illegal aliens? Illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens do. They do.
    O'Reilly: This guy shouldn't have been here.
    Rivera: Cool your jets. It has nothing to do with illegal aliens. It has to do with drunk driving.
    Rivera: Don't obscure a tragedy to make a cheap political point.
    O'Reilly: If I'm the father ..
    Rivera: It's a cheap political point!
    O'Reilly: No, it isn't.
    Rivera: And you know it!
    O'Reilly: This is justice.
    Rivera: This has nothing to do with that poor old lady mayor.
    O'Reilly: And you want anarchy.
    Rivera: Has nothing to do with that mayor.
    O'Reilly: No. You want anarchy. You want open-border anarchy.
    Rivera: No. What I want ..
    
    3:50
    Rivera: But to take this tragedy in Virginia Beach, and make it about illegal aliens ..
    O'Reilly: It is.
    Rivera:  .. is a sin. That is a sin.
    O'Reilly: Bull. This family lured no one. This family lost their daughter.
    Rivera: Three hundred and forty-seven drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans.
    Rivera: Do we care about them?
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans that way. And I deal with it all the time.

    "A Georgetown University co-ed told Representative Nancy Pelosi's hearing that the women in her law school program are having so much sex they're going broke buying birth control pills.

    "Speaking at a hearing held by Pelosi to tout Obama's mandate that virtually every health insurance plan cover the full cost of contraception and abortion-inducing products, Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke said that it's too expensive to have sex in law school without mandated insurance coverage.

    "Apparently, four out of every ten co-eds are having so much sex that it's hard to make ends meet if they have to pay for their own contraception, said Sandra Fluke's research."

    Can you imagine if you were her parents, how proud of Sandra Fluke you would be? Your daughter goes up to a Congressional hearing conducted by the botox-filled Nancy Pelosi and testifies she's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them. Or the Pope.

    "Forty percent of the female students at Georgtown Law reported to us", said Sandra Fluke, "that they struggled financially as a result of this policy." The policy is Georgetown University's student insurance doesn't cover contraception. It costs a female student $3000.00 to have protected sex over the course of her three year stint in law school, according to the calculations. "Without insurance coverage, contraception as you know can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school," Fluke told the hearing. $3,000 for birth control in three years, that's a $1000 a year for sex and she wants us to pay for it.

    All of this just since January 7. Just since January 7. You guys who are thinking you're not going to go to college, let me just say one thing to you: Georgetown. They're admitting before a Congressional committee they're having so much sex they can't afford the birth control pills. That's all you've got to come up with. And all of this is the Republicans' fault.

    Susan Fluke, Fluke, one of the Butt Sisters being dragged out of law school by the hair. Wait 'til Rick Santorum hears about this.  Wait 'til Gingrich hears about this. What do you think he'll do. They'll put a stop to this right away. They'll head over to that university. They'll stop it. They'll spy on Susan Fluke and interrupt her in mid-coitus. And then they'll make them get married. Make 'em get married and make 'em have those babies, and make 'em have 10,000 babies and then stay home. Listening to the Troglodytes by the Jimmy Castor Bunch.

    What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex? What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us. We're the pimps, the johns. That's right. We will be the johns.

    No! We're not the johns. Well, err. That's right.  Pimp's not the right word. Ok, so she's not a slut. She's round-heeled, I take it back.

    Howard Stern: Because it's true about Jay. Jay had to sell Doritos. I mean, it's so true about him. Like he had enough money. It's like, when I see guys on radio who make good money, like fucking, fat Rush Limbaugh, selling on his website, every piece of shit, including Excellence In Broadcasting chair to his audience. Yeh, OK. Like some guy might say to me, Hey, what's wrong with that. If people want an Excellence In Broadcasting chair, why shouldn't Rush sell it. Because Rush makes enough money. Like you don't have to be a whore for everything.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, you understand Jackie selling his cups.
    Howard Stern: Right.
    Robin Quivers: Because he needs the money.
    Howard Stern: Right. Yeah, I know. When he was on our show, he was making a lot of money. 
    Robin Quivers: I'm talking about now.
    Howard Stern: Now he's got to sell a cup. He's one step from holding out a cup in the street. But the fact of the matter is that, you know, I see guys, like Rush Limbaugh, who supposedly has a house in Palm Beach.
    Robin Quivers: He's got a plane.
    Howard Stern: He's got his own private plane. He's looking to buy a football team. And he's still got to sell you his Excellence In Broadcasting key chains.
    Man: He's got it. He's loaded.
    Howard Stern: How about giving those dittoheads a key chain for free, you know.
    Robin Quivers: If you need somebody to be carrying around your emblem, give it to them.
    How Stern: And we are in show business, so there are certain things you have to sell. Like, for example, this service. I mean, it's not going to survive if there aren't subscribers. And there are things that you do sell. Maybe you write a book. Maybe not. I don't, I don't begrudge Rush Limbaugh
    Robin Quivers: How did he get into the chair business?
    Howard Stern: That's what I mean. I mean, why not just make .. He has Rush Limbaugh ties, I think. 
    Robin Quivers: Yes, He does. I think so.
    Howard Stern: Neckties, because look so spiffy. And don't sell the audience everything. You're not in the necktie business.

    01:24: Howard Stern: Okay. So let me explain something to you. The state of Hawaii, when someone is born, they don't issue a birth certificate. They issue a certificate that proves birth. But it's an abbreviated version. In other words, Obama didn't make this up. He didn't say, "I'm the only guy who was ever born in Hawaii who's going to have this abbreviated birth certificate. It's a birth certificate. It's legal. The man has been able to work. He's been able to carry on his life, having this birth certificate. It isn't the full birth certificate. This is what they issued everyone. Anyone born the same year as Obama got the same fucking thing. Everyone. So, why, if you have a half a brain, and you've got any kind of IQ or time on your hands, would you sit there and question it? In other words, what do you think, he got an abbreviated birth certificate on his own? He's the only guy who's ever born in Hawaii. Everyone who was born in Hawaii has the same stupid thing.
    Robin Quivers: Well, the whole idea is that Hawaii would go into collusion with him because they wanted a president from their state.
    Scott Depace: You're missing the point.
    Howard Stern: No, no. I haven't. I heard your point on the air. Here's .. I'll address your point. So he becomes president. And he hears .. Like if I became president, and I heard people saying, Well I don't believe Howard Stern was born in the United States, I wouldn't even pay attention to it. I'd be like, What, what the fuck are you talking about? And then, I'd go on and be the president.
    Scott Depace: It wasn't just a couple people saying it. They were passing laws in states that said he was going to have to produce it. It's huge.
    Howard Stern: Scott, this is ridiculous as anything. You don't .. If you're the president of the United States, and you're worried about A. I hope today I wake up, I hope, uh, I hope the economy doesn't crash. B. I hope I don't get assassinated.
    Scott Depace: You're wrong. You're so wrong. Howard, This thing was taken care of. Apparently, this thing was ..
    ...
    Howard Stern:  You know how many people believe in this country that we didn't land on the moon? So the president knows this. And he goes, How am I going to prove to those wack fucks out there that we did land on the moon.
    Scott Depace: Well apparently he did. 
    Howard Stern: How am I going to do it? How am I going to prove it to them. He didn't wake up saying, I'm going to prove to every conspiracy jerk-off, A. where I was born, B. that we landed on the moon. Like these imbeciles don't think Osama bin Laden's dead. Our military, God bless our military. I'll tell you why they're so smart. And why our president is smart. They took this ratfuck and threw him right in the ocean. Now, I'll tell you what. It alleviates all problems. You, do you know the nonsense that would be going on with these shitheads we're at war with if the body was still around? If it was laying somewhere. They would be carrying on. They would be like children tantruming. We wouldn't be able to stop the tantruming.
    Robin Quivers: It would be a call to action.
    Howard Stern: They took that body. They dumped it right in the fucking ocean. They aren't worried about whether you believe he is dead or not. The president didn't wake up and say, Oh, Donald Trump's going to tell me I didn't really kill Osama bin Laden.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, the same people who've been questioning my birth certificate will question this.
    Howard Stern: You don't worry about that.
    Scott Depace: Now could I have a minute.
    Howard Stern: No. Yes. A minute with you is torture to me.
    Scott Depace: Well, you know what.
    Howard Stern: It's like waterboarding. It's like you're waterboarding when you talk. 
    Scott Depace: I need to get my own show.
    Howard Stern: You've got to get your own show. Because I heard you on the wrap-up show.
    Scott Depace: Listen, Howard. This happened before he became president. For one, it was questioned. Two, apparently he was able to ..
    Howard Stern. Scott, do you think the president cared?
    ...
    Scott Depace: Do you understand the significance of this, though. Imagine if he was not from this country, and he passed all these laws. Everything would have been null and void.
    Howard Stern: Ha, ha, ha, ha! You're a pisser. He's got a birth certificate.
    Scott Depace: Well, now he's got one. He showed it now.
    Howard Stern: He had it all along. They showed the thing that every citizen who's born in the United States in Hawaii gets. We landed on the moon. 
    Scott Depace: It's pretty simple to prove ...
    Howard Stern. You're out of your mind. My, you're out of your fucking mind. You should jump in the ocean with those ..
    Scott Depace: He should have done it, and it wouldn't have been a problem. I tell you, Right away.
    Scott Depace: Thank you. 
    Howard Stern. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in God?
    Scott Depace: Yes, I do.
    Howard Stern: Why? You can't see him. How do you know he's there?
    Scott Depace: It's called faith.
    Howard Stern: You have faith. Well, have faith the president is from the United States. Get out of here. Right now. Have faith. He has faith. Have faith in your president. Get out of here. You don't have faith? Well, guess what? He got the job done.

    Stern: Look at you.
    O'Reilly: 500 million bucks. That's what I have here. I don't believe it, but 500 million bucks. This Sirius operation is going to pay you in five years. Is that right?
    Stern: Well, first of all. I'm worth every penny.
    O'Reilly: But, is that right? Is it 500 million.
    Stern: No, it's not exactly right.
    O'Reilly: It's close.
    Stern: I don't talk about my salary.
    O'Reilly: I understand.
    Stern: Because if I try to hire a plumber, I can't get one to come to my house, because they think I'm walking around with 500 million dollars.
    O'Reilly: But this is in the ballpark. 500 million.
    Stern: No, it's not in the ballpark. I'm not making 500 milllion. But I'm making a lot of money.
    O'Reilly: Okay. But it's you and your operation. You're paying your corporation. You're paying your corporation.
    Stern: Right.
    O'Reilly: Between 80 and 100 million a year.
    Stern: Listen to you. You're so jealous. That's why you sell all those tchotchkes every night at the end of the show. 
    O'Reilly: You want to get that out of the way, up top?
    Stern: You want to do the tchotchkes later? Or you want to do it now?
    O'Reilly: Let's do it later.
    Stern: All right. But, you've got a good answer. You do it for charity, so it's ,, that's enough.
    O'Reilly: You already know that. Your informers tipped you off. But, I got a couple of beefs with you about it. But, we'll ...
    Stern: You know what happened to me since I came into this building? And then we'll get to the tough stuff.
    O'Reilly: No, we don't really have time for that.
    Stern: You don't care.
    O'Reilly: No. I don't care what happened to you. I know you were in the makeup chair for a long time. And it's obvious why.
    Stern: Well, I need makeup, because I said, You, you are the Brad Pitt of this channel. And to really sit here with Bill O'Reilly and try to look good next to this handsome man, I said, You'd better put a lot of makeup on me. And I'm sitting there and while I'm in the chair, Geraldo comes waltzing in.
    O'Reilly: Talk about handsome man, huh?
    Stern: Yuh. And I said, Geraldo? First of all, you don't even recognize him. He's got five pounds of makeup caked on him. He's beet red.
    O'Reilly: He's 80 years old. Give him a break.
    Stern: He's got to be. He's got a four-year-old wife and he's got a one-year-old at home. I said, What are you doing? ...
    O'Reilly: But look at your hair. Every curl is manufactured. It's terrific. And you're a radio guy. You're not even on TV.
    Stern: I am on TV. I'm on On Demand. And I was on E! for eleven years. As the number one show on E!.
    O'Reilly: Yeh, it was exciting. You and Joan Rivers. I couldn't get enough of that. OK. So you make a lot.
    Stern: Go ahead. I may be. Does that surprise you? I'm probably the most ..
    O'Reilly: No, but I want to get to the economics of this. So 80 and 100 million a year go into your corporation. You go on Sirius, the satellite radio channel, okay. How are they going to make a profit? I mean, how many people you think are going to go over and .. What are they, 50 bucks for that thing, the subscription?
    Stern: No, is it my problem if they make a profit? Is that my worry? They paid me to go there and entertain the people and that's what I'll do. And they shall come. Umm, what I've heard so far is that when I got there, they had 600,000 subscribers. And lo and behold, it's been a year later, now. And I've been, certainly, it's been in the news that I'm going to satellite. They are now estimating 3.1 million people have joined.
    O'Reilly: And how much is it a year to do ..
    Stern: It's twelve dollars a month for a radio subscription. And I think it's the best ... If you want to get into this, I think it's the best buy in town.
    O'Reilly: All right. So, if they ...
    Stern: Are you going to let me explain?
    O'Reilly: .. get a couple of million, then they can make money off ...
    Stern: Sure. Of course, they're going to make money. Satellite radio, it's inevitable. Because, uh, FM and AM radio have been so regulated, so overly-commercialized. Because the content has been so watered down. Uh, guys like me who make people laugh in the morning and appeal to millions of people can't do our act any more. And guess what's happening. Satellite radio will succeed. Much like cable television, which you're on, has succeeded. Because you can program ..
    O'Reilly: But Fox has succeeded, but MSNBC's a disaster. So it's not a lock. But, I'm glad you gave me the segue.
    Stern: Trust me. With me, it's a lock.
    O'Reilly: Okay. We'll see. What are you going to do differently? Are you going to curse every two minutes? Is that what you're going to do?
    Stern: No, I think you know better than that. And you better calm down. Sit back in your chair.
    O'Reilly: No, I'm okay. I'm relaxed.
    Stern: Because I'll smack you around. You know that.
    O'Reilly: That'd be good because my lawyer, Swifty is right over there.
    Stern: I would take you right out.
    O'Reilly: And I would take a lot of that 100 million.
    Stern: Go ahead, baby. It's all yours. No, but, but, in all seriousness, what was your question again?
    O'Reilly: You see? Are you going to curse every two minutes? What are you going to do?

    Wallace: Who is Bill O'Reilly? Is he a patriot? A blowhard? A braggard? A bully? Well, it turns out there's a lot more to him than any of that. Since we sat down in 2004, he's maintained his domination of cable news. Competitors have tried to copy him. And four nights a week, in perhaps the ultimate flattery. Steven Colbert parodies him on Comedy Central. But we found the man, talking about himself, full of surprises. And he began with one.
    O'Reilly: You know, you're responsible for this O'Reilly deal. And I always tell everybody, You've got a problem with me, you call Mike Wallace. He's responsible for the O'Reilly deal.
    Wallace: What are you talking about?
    O'Reilly: When I was growing up, I didn't care about the news at all. I had no interest in the news. But my father liked you.
    Wallace: You serious about this?
    O'Reilly: No sir, I'm serious about everything. Okay? And I said, That guy, he's pretty interesting. Because he's giving people a hard time. Which is what you did. So then when I got older, and I said, There were three guys that I watched, you, Howard Cosell, This is Howard Cosell. Loved him. My father hated him. And Tom Snyder. Because Snyder knew how to work that camera. You were the three. So, you're responsible. Howard's dead. You can't blame him. But you're still here. So, if you don't like me, you go to Wallace.
    Wallace: Incidentally, let me interrupt. Your wife has told you, Don't point, at Mike.
    O'Reilly: Yup, that was the advice I was given.
    Wallace: But you keep pointing.
    O'Reilly: I know. But I can't, I can't stop.
    Wallace: Go ahead.
    Voice-over: He does do a lot of finger-pointing. [Dialogue with Michael Moore] On his nightly Fox news program, the O'Reilly Factor. [Dialogue with Michael Moore]
    Wallace: You enjoy the arguing. You enjoy tackling what you call justice. You enjoy taking on people on your show.
    O'Reilly: Sure. It's a battle of wits. Who's the quicker draw, intellectually. I enjoy the joust. And I think people enjoy watching the joust and it's one of the reasons we're real successful.
    Voice-over: The O'Reilly Factor is the highest-rated hour on any cable news channel. He told us that over twenty million people a week watch the show. But there are millions more who hear him on radio stations. He's a syndicated columnist, and a best-selling author. All made possible by the enormous success of his cable show. [Factor announcement] The concept was simple enough. Bring the op-ed page to television. [O'Reilly opinion statement] The Factor is all about opinions, O'Reilly's opinions. This about the leaders of Iran. [O'Reilly opinion statement] The Factor formula works. It's made him incredibly popular. And incredibly unpopular too.
    Wallace: When I tell people I'm going to do a profile of O'Reilly. Oh, wonderful, wonderful. Don't let him off the hook. Go get him. Bring him down. You're the guy who can do it.
    O'Reilly: Why? Why do they want me to be brought down? Why?
    Wallace: You could answer your own question.
    O'Reilly: I can't. I don't know who you hang around with. I suspect they're pinheads, but I don't know for sure.
    Voice-over: People tell us they dislike him because of encounters like these. [O'Reilly arguing with 3 people]
    Wallace: That's not an interview. That's a lecture.
    O'Reilly: Oh, I lecture. Well, I'm a commentator. We went back and did research on the last six years of the Factor. You know how many times I told people to shut up? Six. Three times in anger. And three times, just, hey, doing a shut up about things. My program ..
    Wallace: Three times.
    O'Reilly: My house. No, no, no. It's not a free country. My house. You're disrespectful in my house, you're putting things out there that are defamatory in my house, you're going to get taken to the cleaner.
    Voice-over: And outside his house is no different. On Tim Russert's cable show, O'Reilly was paired with New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. [Argument with Paul Krugman] But his most notorious encounter developed at a book fair when he took on humorist Al Franken about a book Franken wrote saying O'Reilly had lied publically on a number of occasions. And used a splotchy picture of him on the cover. [Argument with Al Franken] Their very public battle was about a number of things, one of which was that O'Reilly had said he was an independent. Franken showed he had registered Republican.
    Wallace: What upsets you so, that when Al Franken calls you a liar, and proves it.
    O'Reilly: Proves it. Bull.
    Wallace: Shall I give you book, chapter and verse?
    O'Reilly: Why bother? He's a character assassin. Why lower yourself to that kind of a discourse.
    Wallace: Why does it get you so upset?
    O'Reilly: Because it's dishonest. It's parasitical. And it's character assassination. Why wouldn't I get upset.
    Wallace: But right or wrong, O'Reilly likes to get upset. When O'Reilly was raised Irish Catholic, in Long Island, New York. the son of a middle-class accountant, he said his dad was an under-achiever, who came to blows with him as a teen-ager. But his dad made him scrappy, which has served him well in his career. First though, he had to work his way through college, painting houses.
    O'Reilly: Painting houses taught me something. I didn't want to paint houses.
    Voice-over: His first job in TV was in a small-market Scranton, Pennsylvania.
    O'Reilly: Not like Maria Shriver. Though, the respect to her, nice woman. Who started in Los Angeles. Why? Because her name was Maria Shriver. O'Reilly starts in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with the coal miners. I loved it. My folks. 
    Wallace: Give me a break. Why are you comparing yourself, all of a sudden, with Maria Shriver.
    O'Reilly: Because I'm telling you that this road I took had to be taken. There was no other way to do it.
    Voice-over: For the record, Maria Shriver started in Philadelphia as a low-level assistant. As for O'Reilly? His career took off in 1996, when the fledgling Fox News Channel bought into his idea for a high-energy op-ed TV show. [O'Reilly's first Fox broadcast] And by 1998, it was a bona-fide hit. Must-see TV for the conservative right. [O'Reilly at Republican convention] The old boys' club there welcomed him with open arms. [O'Reilly at Republican convention] Some folks would expect this reception for Bill O'Reilly, a favorite of conservatives. But what you don't expect ..

  - Young Mike Wallace interviews quiz kid

    Wallace: Good evening... tonight as a special pre Christmas program, we go after the story of a child prodigy, one of the biggest money winners in television quiz show history. He's twelve-year-old Lennie Ross, the California school boy who won a total of one hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars on The Big Surprise and The Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Challenge with his amazing knowledge of the stock market.

    Wallace: Lennie, in a moment I shall ask you what you think of quiz shows, egg-heads, President Eisenhower, American education and Santa Claus. My name is Mike Wallace, the cigarette is Philip Morris.

    Commercial: Philip Morris. The natural smoke with a man's kind of mildness presents the Mike Wallace Interview.

    Wallace: We'll talk with Lennie Ross in just a minute. I'll bet there are smokers in your Christmas list who would welcome a gift carton like this. This handsome package of today's Philip Morris contains 200 smokes, with a man's kind of mildness. Two hundred smokes that taste just right. Because you see, there's a straight forward character to this cigarette. And yet there's mildness here too. Genuine mildness. No filter, no fooling. No artificial mildness. And that's the reason I like today's Philip Morris. That's why I'll be giving cartons of Philip Morris like this one. And I hope you will too. And during the holidays, if company's coming to your house, it might be a good idea to have some smokes on hand for them to enjoy. So pick up a few extra cartons. I'm sure any smoker will appreciate the man's kind of mildness in this cigarette. Today's Philip Morris.

    Wallace: And now to our story. In recent years, America has found a new set of heroes, quiz contestants like Teddy Nadler, Charles Van Doren and twelve-year-old Lennie Ross, and now that Russian Sputniks are whirling above our heads, it's generally agreed that America needs more youngsters like young Leonard Ross. Tonight we'll try to find out what he thinks of his problems and of ours. Lennie, first of all, let me ask you this, you've made a hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars answering questions, how does it feel to be doing it for free?

    Ross: I think I enjoy it. uh... I wouldn't tell until the end of the program before I can say for sure.

    Wallace: All right, I'll ask you that question again later. Last week, Lennie, the United Press asked one of the original radio Quiz Kids, actress Vanessa Brown, why she refused to appear on TV Quiz Shows and she said, "Because I want to be an actress, not an oddity. To appear on a quiz show -- she said -- there's no trick to it at all, it's a matter of collecting and saving facts like some people collect money." How do you feel about that?

    Ross: Well, quiz shows are entertainment like the Mike Wallace Interview and I certainly a lot of the questions asked deal with facts which are not too useful, but not everything is useful. Certainly there... a number of things that a person acquires are material things and information, which have no actual use and I think the quiz show is an entertainment based on the fact that some people have accumulated a specialized knowledge of a subject.

    Wallace: You don't feel, then, that you were a freak or an oddity when you answered stock market questions that might've stopped -stumped, as a matter of fact did stump, veteran stock brokers. You didn't feel like a...

    Ross: A stock broker is not in the business of acquiring facts about the stock market. Which stocks paid dividends in a certain year. However, if you're, if somebody is not in the business and has a side interest, it's perfectly normal to acquire such facts. And thus you won't find the professional knowing them, and that's natural.

    Wallace: Well, is it possible you just have a freak memory. For instance, Charles Van Doren said ..

    You've heard so many stories about my father this week. Here's one you haven't heard. Three summers ago, Caroline Wallace, then aged one, went to Martha's Vineyard to visit her great-grandfather. Here she is, literally taking the first step of her life reaching out to him. This week, when she learned he had passed away, Caroline, who is now four. drew this picture of her favorite stuffed bunny, herself, and her great grandpa. And she dictated this message for him, to her teacher. 'I love you. I miss you because I wanted to say goodbye.' And then she signed it.

    Back in 2005, when my father was 87, he had just written a book. He came on Fox News Sunday to talk about that, and all sorts of things.

    Chris: Do you understand why some people feel such disaffection for the mainstream media?
    Mike: Oh, yeah, yeah. They think we're wild-eyed commies, liberals. Yes?
    Chris: That's what they think. And how do you plea?
    Mike: I think it's damn foolishness. First of all, they're patriots. Just as much as any conservative. Even a liberal reporter is a patriot. Wants the best for this country. And people, you know, your 'Fair and Balanced' friends at Fox don't fully understand that.
    Chris: All right. Let's talk about the book.
    Mike: Yes.
    Chris: Because what's amazing is all the people you have interviewed over the years. In the case of the Middle East, everyone from Menachem Begin to Anwar Sadat. From the Shah of Iran to the Ayatollah Khomeini.
    Mike: 'He calls you, Imam--forgive me, his words, not mine--a lunatic.'
    Chris: Now, when you say, 'Forgive me,' to a Middle East leader, does that mean you're about to drop the hammer?
    Mike: Frequently, frequently, that's exactly right.
    Chris: Someone once said about you, that Mike Wallace has an underdeveloped sense of other people's privacy. And as your son, I'm here to testify it's absolutely true.
    Mike: Really?
    Chris: Yes. Ah, I want to ..
    Mike: What have I revealed about you that upsets you.
    Chris: Well, no, but I want to show you something. A few clips from interviews that you have done with celebrities over the years. Take a look.
    Mike: 'You really believe in extra-terrestrials? Do they come visit you on the porch? Now you're being unpleasant, Wallace, is what you're saying.'
    Shirley MacLaine: Yes, this is what I was a little afraid of. But you don't have to be that unpleasant. It doesn't become you.'
    Johnny Carson: I stopped doing jokes immediately, as soon as people found out that he was an alcoholic.
    Mike: Of course, it takes one to know one.
    Johnny Carson: Oh. Cruel. You're cruel.
    Chris: Why do you, why do you do that?
    Mike: Why do I do what?
    Chris: Why do you sit there and say, It takes one to know one?
    Mike: He's a drunk.
    Chris: Or why do you say to Barbara Streisand on national television, 'You know what your mother says, You don't have time for anyone?'
    Mike: These are interesting questions. Why are you asking? Because they're interesting questions.
    Chris: Do you ever say to yourself, I'm going to embarrass them, I'm going to hurt his feelings?
    Mike: No, no. I don't have subpoena powers. They know who I am when they come on. They know the kind of questions that I ask all my ... Actually, I didn't start really asking questions until I was 38 years old. But, and I had to do certain things. I remember before, before we lost your brother, I used to, you know, do all kinds of ..
    Chris: Commercials. Cigarette commercials. Send me to college.
    Mike: That's correct. And I used to say, I've got to raise the kids. Therefore, I'll do whatever I have to do. And after we lost Peter, I said, I can't hide behind that anymore. And what I'm going to do is, in the memory of your brother, your older brother, Peter, I'm going to do something that I am proud of doing and that he would be proud to have me do.
    Chris: As you look over the whole career, all the places you've gone, all the people you've met, what do you make of it? I mean, what do you make of Myron Leon Wallace, from Brookline Massachusetts, having had this extraordinary journey?
    Mike: It is extraordinary. It is just, sometimes I can't believe it. Can you imagine talking to Eleanor Roosevelt back in 1957? This extraordinary woman.
    Chris: I want to ask you a question, that in the book, and I didn't realize you'd ever asked it, but that you asked Thomas Hart Benton, the great artist, in 1973. And you asked him, and I'm asking you, Do you hate getting old?
    Mike: Well, I'll tell you what. I had my hearing aids fixed today, so that I could properly hear you. I can't see as well. I used to be able to play tennis. I now have--this has stopped me from smoking--a pacemaker, have for about the last 15 years. Yeh, I don't like getting old.
    Chris: And you don't retire because?
    Mike: Because I love .. It is not work that I do. I love what I do. When I get up in the morning, and I think, I am going to have the opportunity to .. I wasn't that happy about waking up this morning.
    Chris: I felt the same way. All right. Finally, I have another idea for a target for your next interview. And the question is: What would you like to ask this fellow?
    Voice-over: October the 30th. William's 3-week birthday.
    Chris: What would you like to ask him?
    Mike: He's a good-looking kid, isn't he?
    Chris: Yes. He takes after his mother.
    Mike: That's right. He does.
    Chris: You've never seen this tape.
    Mike: No, I've never seen this .. I have the still. He moves around. That's a nice surprise. Bless you.
    Chris: Well, it's a great book. It is a great life. I couldn't be prouder of both. And I love you.
    Mike: I love you. And I'm proud of you.
    Chris: After we ran that interview, I said, There's no crying on Sunday morning talk shows. Well, there have been lots of tears this week, along with lots of laughs, and some wonderful stories. Our family has really held on to each other tightly. Over the last two decades, my father became my best friend. He was so interesting, so much fun to be around. And, yes, sometimes, so exasperating. I didn't get into reporting, at least, consciously, because of him. But we used to get such joy from sharing experiences with each other. So many times this week, I've wanted to ask him what he thinks about all the coverage of his life. And then I stopped, and remembered he's not here. That is going to take some getting used to. I can't imagine life without him. We'll see you, next Fox News Sunday.

    Tapper: 00:12 Good morning, everyone. George Stephanopoulos has a well-deserved morning off. We're exactly six months from Election Day. And in case you had any doubt, the presidential campaign is officially in full swing, with President Obama holding his first two re-election rallies yesterday in the critical battleground states of Ohio and Virginia.

    The president was a wee bit rusty at first, nearly forgetting his wife Michelle as he walked off Air Force One in Columbus. Oh, there she is. And after that, the first lady introduced him at Ohio State.

    Michelle Obama: We just cannot turn back now, right? We have come so far, but we have so much more to do.

    Tapper: And then the president stepped up and made his pitch.

    Obama: If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them it's still about hope. You tell them it's still about change.

    Tapper: And let's now bring in the president's chief campaign strategist, David Axelrod. David, thanks for joining us.

    Axelrod: Sure. Good to be with you, Jake.

    Tapper: The president kicked off his campaign in Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia. And here are the headlines in the newspapers that greeted him, which were reporting on Friday's jobs report. The Columbus Dispatch: Job numbers don't mirror hope. The Richmond Times-Dispatch: April job growth slight. Portion of Americans in labor force falls to lowest level since 1981.

    The headlines say it all, don't they? The economy just isn't strong enough. And what the president has been able to accomplish has not been enough.

    Axelrod: Well, Jake, let's consider where we were when the president took office. We were losing 800,000 jobs in one month. We lost 4 million in the six months before he took office, or nearly 4 million. In the last 26 months, we've gained 4.2 million private-sector jobs. The last 6 months, we've gained nearly 200,000 jobs a month.

    And you have to look at the trend, not one month, or short periods of time. Now we have a lot of headwinds. The president said yesterday, we have to be vigilant. We have to be persistent. We've got headwinds from Europe, and the Middle East, and so on. But we have to push forward and Congress can help. The president has offered a series of ideas on small business tax cuts, real small business tax cuts on helping people refinance their mortgages. Take advantage of low interest rates. On getting a surface transportation bill done. All of these will help our economy move forward. But we can't .. what we can't do is go back to doing what we were doing before the crisis, because that'll result in the same disastrous outcome for our economy and the middle class.

    Tapper: And David, when the president gave his speech yesterday, he acknowledged that people are still hurting. Let's take a look.

    Obama: The real question, the question that will actually make a difference in your life and in the lives of your children is not just about how we're doing today. It's about how we'll be doing tomorrow.

    Tapper: David, it seems as though the president is acknowledging that he cannot win on the premise, Are you better off than you were four years ago. Doesn't that in itself suggest failure?

    Axelrod: No. As I said Jake, we've come a long way from what we were. We're in the middle of recovering from this recession. But there's a larger project, which is, how do we rebuild this economy in the long-term so the middle class is growing and not shrinking and people who work hard can get ahead, people who act responsibly are rewarded for that responsibility? That's what we're working on.

    And what we can't do is what Governor Romney has suggested, which is to go back to the same formula that -- that hurt our economy and hurt so many people, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that we can't afford, cutting Wall Street loose to make its own rules. That is not a prescription for the kind of growth that we need in this country. 

    And by the way, I would note that in 2004, when the recovery from that recession was more laggered than what we have today, Governor Romney ran around this country saying that President Bush ought not to be blamed for that and it was just politics to blame him for that. I suggest it's just politics when you hear Governor Romney today, and he certainly wants to go back to that same disastrous formula. 

    Tapper: One of the issues that you guys are going to be facing, one of the headwinds is the lack of enthusiasm, or at least less enthusiasm. When I covered you guys, your campaign in 2007, 2008, you would -- you and your staff members would excitedly regale us with the huge numbers of crowds, crowd estimates. At OSU, at Ohio State yesterday, in a stadium that seats about 18,000, there were roughly 14,000 people there. Now, granted, those 14,000 were very excited. They supported the president. But there were still more than 4,000 empty seats. Doesn't that indicate that there is a problem you're facing when it comes to fewer people who are excited about the president? 
  
    Axelrod: Jake, you should have gone along on the whole trip. In Virginia, there was an overflow crowd. And that's the way it is. But the fact is that 14,000 is 11,000 more than the largest crowd that Mitt Romney has ever drawn.

    So I think there's enthusiasm for the president's candidacy. And, you know, we've got tremendous volunteer response. Just from that event, we got thousands of more volunteers in our campaign. I am certain that we are going to have an enthused volunteer core and enthused electorate out there.

    The thing that we've seen over time is that Republican enthusiasm has dropped precipitously, partly because what we've seen from Governor Romney is all negative. Ninety percent of the ads that he's run in this campaign, $55 million of advertising, 90 percent of it he and his team have run have been negative. His attacks, his speeches now are entirely negative attacks on the president, doesn't talk about his own record, doesn't really talk about his vision. 
  
    That is not going to create enthusiasm. I think what the president's talking about will create enthusiasm, which is, how do we build an economy in which the middle class has a shot, everybody gets a fair shake, everybody has some confidence that their kids might do better in the future? That's the project we're working on.

    BOB GARFIELD:  After the initial shock following Pope Benedict's sudden resignation last week, plans swung into motion for the next Vatican Conclave to appoint a new pontiff. The usual reporters on the Pope beat will be joined by a global horde of journalists in every medium. Among them will be Rocco Palmo who usually covers the Catholic Church from his home in Philadelphia. His blog, Whispers in the Loggia, is widely read and widely praised, including by NPR, which called it "a must-read for church insiders."

    Palmo co-chaired the Vatican's first-ever Social Media Conference and has cultivated a stable of sources that gives him eyes and ears inside the Papacy. Palmo says he owes much of his success in building relationships in Rome to his hometown.

    ROCCO PALMO:  I grew up in a very thickly Catholic culture here in Philadelphia. In this city, even Jews don't identify themselves by what neighborhood they come from but what Catholic parish they come from.  And so, as, as a young kid, I got to meet the Cardinal - then, at the time, Anthony Bevilacqua. And I just had a lot of dumb questions and started asking them and, you know, 22 years later, here we are.

    BOB GARFIELD:  You break so many scoops. You have [LAUGHS] sources that may be unparalleled. How do you cultivate sources in this extremely secretive culture?

    ROCCO PALMO:  At least for me, it feels like second nature. When you know how to speak the language, it's not hard because when somebody can talk to me and know that I understand when they talk about Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Vatican II document which allowed the mass to be celebrated in vernacular languages, that alone opens up a lot of doors.

    It's also just a sense of, of knowing how the system works. And, you know, one concern of mine going into this Conclave is that religion reporters, in general, major outlets in this country, whether broadcast or print, are an endangered species. And you can't be a GA reporter throw into this story, because you're not going to understand the basics of the Catholic Church, let alone the, the nuances.

    ...

    05:20 BOB GARFIELD:  You've mentioned Pope Benedict's isolation. I'm curious first whether you think that his papacy was damaged by that isolation and whether you believe that his successor, whoever that may be, will be more exposed to the outside world and the outside world have a more transparent view of him?

    ROCCO PALMO:  You can take it to the bank that the Catholic Church is going to emerge from this Conclave with a Pope who, for the first time is going to be used to having a computer on his desk and probably a smart phone in his pocket and quite possibly an iPad on the coffee table. When the Pope himself knows how to go on the Internet and knows how to read comment boxes or Twitter, he sees the world without a filter, and that takes the world's last great gilded cage and shatters it.

    BOB GARFIELD:  Do you think that the digital revolution is going to fundamentally change how the church as a whole interacts with the outside world?

    ROCCO PALMO:  I grew up in the newsroom. My father worked for the Philadelphia newspapers for 30 years. And what I see in my father and, intriguingly enough, I've seen in many priests, that kind of cataclysm, that kind of severe stress because the demands and the, the changing nature of things are not what they signed up for. And it's, it's intriguing because, you know, the press and the church are traditionally seen as being at loggerheads with each other. But, you know, both in terms of the nitty-gritty of the day today but in terms of the concepts of what both do, they're really the same. They're both looking for the truth.

    BOB GARFIELD:  Rocco, thank you very much.

    ROCCO PALMO:  Anytime, Bob. Thank you.

    BOB GARFIELD:  Rocco Palmo will be covering the Vatican Conclave from Rome on his blog, Whispers in the Loggia.

    Clip 1:
    Torre: ... some facts about the other. You're going to tell me that they're true or false.
   James, while on a recruiting trip to a Pac-10 team, an assistant coach called Jeremy the wrong ...
    Harden: True.
    Torre: Jeremy?
    Lin: The coach called me ... uh, he called me Ron Jeremy. I kid you not.

    Torre: Jeremy? Earlier this year, James inspired a Thunder fan to get a tattoo of his face on his arm. True or false?
    Lin: True.
    Torre: Correct! And it's not a small tattoo either. In fact ... 
    Lin: Oh ... my ... god.

    Lin: You didn't see that?

    Harden: False! False! False! False! False! False!
    Lin: Yes, it was at middle school. We were playing, me and my church friends, and I dunked it, and I swear I could not sleep that night. It was like, being Asian and everything, not being able to  get to the point where .. Like none of my friends had ever done it before, none of my brothers had ever done it before. So I remember that for sure.

    Torre: Jeremy, James is regarded as a frustrating video game opponent because he refuses to get emotional. True or false?
    Lin: Hmm. I'm going to go, I'm going to go True.
    Harden: Get pissed at video games. That's my hobby, I mean I play video games the majority of the time when I'm not on the court. So, I mean, when I lose, when I'm losing on video games, you know, that's another side of me.
    Torre: I heard controllers get broken.
    Harden: Yes, controllers get broken. Things like that.
 
    James, as a freshman in high school, Jeremy got a 790 out of 800 on his advanced math SAT II subject test.
    Harden: True.
    Torre: False! Jeremy got a perfect 800.
    Harden: Oh my goodness! Oh shit.
    
    Lin: That's crazy! I still remember that because the highest score I had ever gotten was a 670 on all, like, the practice tests. So I came home and told my mom, "I was, I got an 800," and she just laughed at me. And I did. I don't know how it happened. It was a miracle.
    Torre: Where does that currently rank on your list of life achievements?
    Lin: That's pretty low.

    Clip 2:
    Steele: Do you have to have hatred to succeed in this sport? Because here's the thing. He's a really nice guy. Behind the scenes. Do you have to hate your opponents to win?
    Sonnen: Can I touch your hair? Can I feel? I love your hair, by the way. 
    Steele: Random.
    Sonnen: That has never happened before? Because everybody that's sit in this chair is thinking. And I can assure you. That's real hair, people. And it's very soft, I might add. What is the question? About Saturday night?

    Clip 3:
    It's Joakim Noah and the Bulls again in Brooklyn. It's Game 2. The Nets' first quarter. Keith Bogans setting things up for Brook Lopez, who hammers home the finish. He, again at 21. had the home team within 4.

    Later in the second quarter, Lopez hit three straight shots from almost the exact same spot. That jumper had the Nets within a deuce. In final seconds, opening half, C. J. Watson playing beat the buzzer on the three-ball, had the Nets within a point at the break.

    Third quarter though, Chicago's [...] get involved. That's Carlos Boozer on the face-up jumper. He and Noah each had double doubles of points and rebounds. Noah here off the feed from Luol Deng puts Chicago up a half-dozen. 11 was the bad number for the Nets in that third quarter. They were held to 11 points, shot 11 percent. Joe Johnson off along the baseline leads to a run-out with Kirk Hinrich, finding Jimmy Butler on the [...] Chicago goes up a dozen.

    Nets fight back in the fourth quarter and it's behind Johnson, who hits on the quarter trey, here gets them within nine. Johnson this time from the top of the [...] goes down. He had 17, Nets within four. But the Bulls had answers, [...] Luol Deng takes the hand-off and nails the jumper, lead back up to a half dozen. Then, it's Noah off the dribble and off the window on the finish. As good as Deron Williams was in Game 1, he was abysmal in Game 2, missing eight of his nine shots, while Chicago is even in this series at a game apiece.

    8:25 To our keynoter. Jayson Blair is from just up the road near Centerville, Virginia and attended the University of Maryland. He was a 27-year-old reporter for the New York Times. On March 11, 2003, when it was disclosed in a sensational front-page story, that he had, quote, committed frequent acts of journalistic fraud, while covering significant news events in recent months. The widespread fabrication and plagiarism represented a profound betrayal of trust and a low point in the 152-year history of the newspaper. The Times went on, quote, the reporter misled readers and Times colleagues with dispatches that purported to be from Maryland, Texas and other states when often he was far away in New York. He fabricated comments. He concocted scenes. He lifted material from other newspapers and wire services. He selected details from photographs to create the impression he had been somewhere or seen someone, when he had not, unquote. The Times reporters assigned to sifting the debris found that of 73 stories Blair had written between October '02 and May '03, 36 had substantial problems. Like journalists elsewhere, the Times took this very hard. The paper's post-mortem ran 7,000 words. It was published in its most widely-circulated edition on a Sunday, and it started on page 1. By comparison, a year later when the paper finally recognized that its pre-war coverage of weapons of mass destruction was badly flawed, the acknowledgement ran eleven hundred words, not 7,000, was published on page A-10 on a Wednesday.

    In the aftermath, simmering friction boiled over at the Times. The two top editors of the newspaper, Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd, who was a keynoter at this very institute a few years ago, were forced to resign and a wide-ranging reappraisal of management practices ensued. Indeed to some observers, it looked as if the affair was like a blown tire that kept a high performance car that was being handled recklessly from being driven over a cliff.

    So Jayson Blair, an energetic, and talented, and deeply-troubled young man, who longed to matter, ended up mattering in ways that he had not anticipated, and I suspect never would have chosen. But that was then. Jayson's with us today. I read a profile of his re-emergence as a life coach in the Washington Post in August. We got in touch. And here we are. Perhaps now he has a chance to matter in different ways and to re-dedicate himself to the possibility of making a difference for the better. But I'm here neither to praise Jayson Blair nor to bury him. But to present him in the hope that his story will contribute to the preservation of the profession of journalism, a profession that many of us love, and all of us need. I give you Jayson Blair.

    Blair: Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Are we good? OK. Um, it's always nice to visit the Shenandoah Valley. Um, there are few parts of the world for me that are so beautiful, and few that have been home to such interesting people. Um when I was first approached about speaking at Washington and Lee, I was hesitant about re-opening an old wound of mine and of the journalism profession. But I was convinced that there were more lessons to be learned from my experiences. I believe in what Robert E. Lee, a strong promoter of the journalism program at Washinton and Lee said when he came to the school as president, after Appomattox. He said that it is the duty of all citizens to do all in their power to aid in the restoration and peace, of peace and harmony. I believe that it is my duty, despite my new focus on psychological coaching and mental health causes, to do what I can to aid journalism students by providing them guidance on how to avoid the rocky roads that lead to ethical transgressions.

    My intention and my hope is that this will be my last public comment on journalism. I hope to reserve future conversations about my career in journalism to private audiences of students and for individuals who might be able to benefit from my experience, learn from my mistakes and be inspired by my recovery.

    I am at peace with the knowledge that there is no-one, or nothing to blame for my troubles but myself. I have been accused of attempting to deflect blame, the fabrication and plagiarism on the New York Times, the profession of journalism, and [...] substances, race, and an allotment of other people, places and things. Those accusations of blame are as big untruths as the lies I told. I am here because of choices I made. It is in those choices that we find lessons to be learned. It is in those choices that we can find power to effect change. Understanding those choices is helping me better appreciate the human condition. Understanding those choices has helped me learn how I went from being a person who nobly pledged to comfort the afflicted and to seek the truth into a man who left some deep scars on his chosen profession.

    Understanding those choices may never make up for what happened. But it has the potential to help strengthen the profession that was so deeply wounded. I recognize that I am but one of the voices that contribute to the lessons that can be learned from my experiences. I realize that I see my experience through a looking glass that provides great insight and great distortion. As the French author and moralist, Francois de La Rochefoucauld said, The defects and faults of the mind are like wounds to the body. After all imaginable care has been taken to heal them, still there will be a scar left behind.

    One of my favorite newspaper movies is the 1994 classic, The Paper. It's by Ron Howard. The movie is a comedy drama about a fictitious newspaper tabloid called the New York Sun. The movie stars Robert Duvall as the battle-worn editor-in-chief and Michael Keaton as the eager, young, workaholic metro editor. Toward the end of the movie, Duvall's editor-in-chief character is sitting at a bar with Keaton's metro editor character. Duvall's character asks a theoretical question of Keaton's character, whose wife is pregnant, and who was asking him to spend less time at work. Let me give you a hypothetical, the Duvall character asks. A guy breaks into an apartment. He's got a gun, holds it to her head. He says, I blow your wife's brain out. Or I blow up the Sun building. Choose. Now what do you say? Keaton's character replies, What do you think I say? It's ridiculous. It's not going to happen. And Duvall's character responds, That's exactly my point. It's never one big dramatic choice. It's little vague situations everyday. And you're either there or you're not. If you keep waiting for the guy with the gun to show up, it'll be too late. Duvall knew (His character was divorced. His daughter wouldn't speak to him. All he had was the paper.)

    Now while the focus of this story is about how a noble family man slowly transforms into a workaholic, who loses his family, it's instructive, it's an instructive lesson about choices. Rarely are choices in life presented as a major dramatic question. If they were, it would be easy. If I had been asked one day, whether I wanted to destroy my career, trash my profession, and undermine belief in journalism, I would have unambiguously declined, regardless of the potential benefits. But life's difficult choices rarely present themselves in one dramatic question, or in one big decision. Instead, our most important choices in life, including ethical ones, present themselves in small baby steps. One step at a time.

    Clip 1:
    Lamb: Then, let me ask you about something that, um, .. along those lines. You know, we prepared for your, this interview. Your people at the publishing house told us there were all kinds of rules, things we couldn't ask you about.
    Scalia: You can ask me about anything at all but I just, I won't answer a lot of stuff.
    Lamb: Oh, I know. But, one of the things we, four years ago when we did an interview we talked about Bush v. Gore, and I know you don't want to talk about that again, but let me just show you some video from an interview you did with Piers Morgan when he asked you, I mean, he asked you everything that we're not supposed to ask you and you answered everything that we're not supposed to ask you.
    Scalia: Did I do that?
    Lamb: Yes, you did that. I want to show you this clip.
    Scalia: No, ask me again.
    Lamb: Here's this, let me just show you this.

    Video:
    Piers Morgan, CNN: Well, what has been, in your view, the most contentious, what's the one that most people ask you about?
    Scalia: Contentious? Well, I guess the one that, you know, created the most, most waves of disagreement was Bush versus Gore, OK? That comes up all the time and my usual response is, 'Get over it.'

    Lamb: Why is it, you went on to explain further on that and we did it four years ago.
    Scalia: Did they tell you that you couldn't ask about, I didn't know that that was the guide [..]
    Lamb: Yes. Well, we're used to that. We get that all the time.
    Scalia: No, I mean, past cases that, uh, OK. I don't mind. Ask me about Bush versus Gore.
    Lamb: I don't want to talk about Bush versus Gore. You've already answered it here.
    Scalia: I don't either.
    Lamb: Why, why, judges have tenure. You're in it for life. Why does everybody worry about things they say in public and not having cameras in the room and all that stuff? Why are you so sensitive about that?
    Scalia: I'm sensitive about it because judges ought, judges ought to express their views on the law in their opinions. Everything I had to say about the real legal issues in Bush versus Gore was set forth in the opinion that I joined.
    Beyond that, I'm just either repeating myself or adding things that really were not the basis for my, for my decision. And, I also don't like drawing the courts into the political maelstrom by, you know, having their opinions repeatedly pawed over, especially the controversial ones.

    Lamb: Why not though? I mean, that's democracy isn't it?

    Scalia: Well, I don't mind the people pawing over them between themselves. But, I don't think it's the role of the judge to give an account of himself to the people. You know, it's the tradition of common law judges not to reply to press criticism.

    We get clobbered by the press all the time. I can't tell you how many wonderful letters I've written to the Washington Post just, just for my own satisfaction and then ripped up and thrown away.

    Lamb: You don't send them?

    Scalia: You don't send them. That's the tradition of the common law judge. You do not respond to criticism. So, why? Why is that? It's because, what the judge has to say is in the judge's opinion.

    Clip 2:
    Lamb: All right, we're about out of time. And ..
    Scalia: We are about out of time.
    Lamb: I've never asked you this on camera, but i'm going to do it now, because ..
    Scalia: OK.
    Lamb: I need to get the latest thinking on ..
    Scalia: OK.
    Lamb: Television in the Court.
    Scalia: Television in the Court.
    Lamb: And the reason I bring it up is that Congress has fooled with resolutions. They've never passed it ..
    Scalia: Yeh.
    Lamb: Ordering the Court to go on television. Why are you so against it?
    Scalia: Brian, I was for it when I first joined the Court and switched and remained on that side of it. I'm against it because I do not believe, as the proponents of television in the Court assert, that the purpose of, of televising our hearings would be to educate the American people. That's not what it would end up doing. If I really thought it would educate the American people, I would be all for it. If the American people sat down and watched our proceedings gavel-to-gavel, they would never again ask, as I'm sometimes asked: "Justice Scalia, why do you have to be a lawyer to be on the Supreme Court? The Constitution doesn't say .. " No, the Constitution doesn't say so. But, if you know what our real business is, if you know that we're not usually contemplating our navel, "Should there be a right to this or that, should there be a right to abortion, should there be a right to homose.. " That's not usually what we're doing. We're usually dealing with the Internal Revenue Code, with ERISA [..], with Patent Law, with all sorts of dull stuff that only a lawyer could understand and perhaps get interested in. If the American people saw all of that, they would be educated. But they wouldn't see all of that.
    Lamb: But we get the ..
    Scalia: Your outfit would carry it all, to be sure, but what most of the American people would see would be 30-second, 15-second take-outs from our argument and those take-outs would not be characteristic of what we do. They would be uncharacteristic.
    Lamb: Yeah, now, what we see is an article in a newspaper that's out of context with what you say is ..
    Scalia: That's fine. But it's, it's ., people read that and they say, "Well, it's an article in a newspaper and the guy may be lying or he may be misinformed." But somehow when you see it live, an excerpt pulled out of an entire, when you see it live, it has a much greater impact. No, it would .. I am sure it will mis-educate the American people, not educate.
    Lamb: Well, we get the audio. We get the audio at the end of the week.
    Scalia: Yeah, but the audio is not of interest to the 15-second take-out people and the 30-second take-out people. The audio isn't of interest precisely because it doesn't have that kind of impact.
    Lamb: But the First Amendment doesn't go, "Well, take-outs are not good. We can't have those 15 second sound bites."
    Scalia: The First Amendment has nothing to do with whether we have to televise our proceedings.
    Lamb: But aren't you an advocate .. ?
    Scalia: You're saying the First Amendment requires us to televise our proceedings?
    Lamb: No, I didn't say that. I just said that you're a big advocate of the first amendment.
    Scalia: I am indeed and it doesn't require us to televise our proceedings.
    Lamb: All right. Last question.

    Sound clip: [..]
    Jim Grubbs: We're in Studio A, the actual on-the-air studio for the Prairie Star, which is the, we call it the campus radio station. But it's distinguished from WUIS by being the student radio station.
    Sound clip: [..]
    Jim Grubbs: We're on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, streaming on the Internet. Um, we're not actually over the air, because there are no frequencies available. We hope one of these days that that changes.
    Kyle Alewelt: We're playing classic rock during the day, kind of a softer side. And then, at 3 o'clock when, you know, school's out, we go hard stuff and we play alternative rock. We mix in some pop hits.
    Jim Grubbs: We have had listeners all around the world in over 50 different countries at this point. Uh, we seem to be a big hit in Europe, uh, late hours their time. This semester, for the first time, we're offering COM 313, which is Introduction to Radio. It's just what it sounds like. And it's sort of the path to getting involved with the student radio station.
    Michael Watson: Not really knowing that the UIS had a college radio station, I took the intro radio class, uh, this spring and just found the station unbelievable.
    Jim Grubbs: They're learning some basic audio production, the basics of being on the air. They're learning a lot about the radio industry. Um, and then this leads to, uh, if they're interested, a series of courses, an audio production class, a programming class, and so on.
    Michael Watson: It's going to look good on the resume, especially here at UIS, it's a great university. And um, having that experience in the past also my old radio stations and this one just enhance my future in the radio business.
    Jim Grubbs: As a communications faculty member, I see this as a learning facility. We have a lot of fun in the learning, but it is a learning facility.
    Kyle Alewelt: I think it's going to continue to grow. And we, not to toot our own horn, but we sound very professional. A lot of other stations, you know, are just, you just hear songs back-to-back and you might hear somebody come on the air and just talk and they really don't have the sound of a professional broadcaster. But we, Jim is really good about teaching us how to be professional.

    Video 2:
    Voice-over: Harvard College was an all-male domain for much of Harvard's history. Even Lamont Library was built for men only, and did not open its doors to women until 1967. Remnants of this gender divide can still be seen in freshman dorms. Some vertical dorms such as Wigglesworth still has only men on the first floor. Many horizontal dorms such as Thayer, have gone co-ed. Further efforts of integration by the college have led to more gender equality on campus. The creation of the women's center in Harvard Yard, for example, highlights this effort to create more spaces for women.
    Gina Helfrich: So we're sitting in the Harvard College Women's Center, which was founded in 2006 and is a space that is dedicated to women and gender issues. This is the first women's center that has had the full support and resources of the college behind it. It's the first women's center that has had full-time staff devoted from the college and it's not just a student-run center. So the Women's Center is sort of a social space for students to gather on campus, as well. We have a conference room that students can book for their meetings. We have a really nice comfortable lounge where people come and hang out, or just do problem sets. We offer free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. We also have a kitchen that's actually available for reservation and we currently have a freshman seminar that's using it for their class, called Romancing the Kitchen. There's low-cost copy-print, free fax. There are work stations at the front, so it's really a pretty bustling place and we see people come through everyday. We're open 9-5, and we also have night hours, Monday through Wednesday from 6 to 10pm.
