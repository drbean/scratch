    "00:57 Local fans of New York Nicks star, Jeremy Lin, defied the rain in Taipei today to get their hands on the first official Linsanity T-shirts made available here in Taiwan. Hundreds of people lined up outside an Adidas store before the limited-edition shirts went on sale at 11am. 

    Some members of the crowds were students. They said they had taken time off school to buy one of the two hundred and fifty shirts.
    
    Two high school students, who were first in line, said they claimed their spot at 7 am.
    
    Each customer was allowed to purchase only one T-shirt, which cost one thousand and ninety NT.
    
    A separate blue "Linsanity" Adidas T-shirt will hit the stores on March the second, when ten thousand T-shirts of both editions will be made available."

    "00:28 You all know that in July of last year there was a very widespread perception that the phone hacking at the News of the World was much more extensive than just two rogue reporters who'd been jailed. And that the Metropolitan Police Service may not have investigated these concerns thoroughly enough.
    Uhm, as has been said, the then Commissioner asked me to do this work. The then Commissioner and and, Assistant Commissioner, as you know, then resigned. Uh, there've been a lot of allegations that senior officers, including them, had been too close to the News of the World, in accepting inappropriate hospitality.
    So what was the job that they asked me to do. Uh, to look at the ethical issues arising from the relationship between the police and the media. To look at what should be the proper purpose of the relationship between the police and the media. What ought to be done to improve public confidence in the relationship between the police and the media, which by that time had taken a severe knocking. And what hospitality is appropriate for police to accept or to give the media.
    What did I do to try and understand the issues? I had discussions with 137 people. A lot of police and police staff within the Met. A lot of journalists, editors, business people, politicians, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and the Inspectorate. Uh, if you want to know who I actually saw, there's a list at the back of my report.
    So what problems did this piece of work were demonstrated or told to me by those people. There was extensive, there is extensive, contact between the media and the Met. And much of it is fine and healthy and straightforward. But there was a lack of transparency and inadequate control in, which led to information being given out which should not have been given out. And in my view, as I'll come on to say, information which ought to have been given out, not being given out.
    There's no doubt that influence and favor played a part in the issues that had arisen. And, in my view, played a part in what ought to be an unbiased and independent relationship of the police with the media. In my view, it did jeopardize the Met's independence. And I got quite a lot of criticism from journalists that access was biased towards certain publications, and some journalists who were, particularly journalists who were scrutinizing the Met, weren't given the same access as others who were seen as friends of the Met.
    So what were the problems that were thrown up? Well, there was quite a lot of disclosure for improper advantage.

    O'Reilly: OK. Sanctuary cities, what do you think?
    Rivera: I think you have the story almost exactly wrong, my friend. I think that we're talking about drunk driving. And you know, there were 347 drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the year 2005. I think this may be the first drunk driving story we've done from Virginia. And the only reason it's news on "The Factor" is because the driver was an illegal alien. What if his name was Bubba? What if his name was Buddy? What if his name was Bobby?
    O'Reilly: Not the same story. Not the same story.
    Rivera: It's not the same story, but still you know, my heart goes out to those parents.
    O'Reilly: I hope so.
    Rivera: But, really it does. But there were 17,000 families that suffered the way those parents have.
    O'Reilly: Yes?
    Rivera: It's not an illegal alien story, Bill. It's a drunk driving story. And I think you owe ..
    O'Reilly: Here's where you're wrong.
    Rivera: .. the mayor an apology. She doesn't enforce immigration policy.
    O'Reilly: She has set up the system in her city, knowingly, that says the police ..
    Rivera: Don't feed me that. What's his name, Lou Dobbs.
    O'Reilly: You listen. Listen to me.
    Rivera: He has regenerated his dead career on the backs of illegal aliens. Let's not go there.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: The Minutemen are wearing guns now on the border.
    O'Reilly: You listen to me. I'll listen to you.
    Rivera: What they going to do. Start shooting illegal aliens?
    O'Reilly: When you enter this country illegally, Number One, you have no right to be here. No right. That's the truth.

    2:22
    Rivera: It could be a Jewish drunk. It could be a Polish drunk.
    O'Reilly: But this guy didn't have to be here.
    Rivera: It could be an Irish drunk.
    O'Reilly: No.
    Rivera: It could be an Italian drunk. What the hell difference does it make?
    O'Reilly: It makes plenty of difference!
    Rivera: It does not, Bill.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be here!
    Rivera: He didn't commit a felony.
    O'Reilly: He doesn't have a right to be in this country!
    Rivera: What - but that has nothing to do with the fact that he was a drunk!
    O'Reilly: Yes, it does! He should have been deported! He should have been deported! And this mayor and the police chief didn't deport him!
    Rivera: Listen, do you know how many people we have in jail? How many of them are illegal aliens? Illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens do. They do.
    O'Reilly: This guy shouldn't have been here.
    Rivera: Cool your jets. It has nothing to do with illegal aliens. It has to do with drunk driving.
    Rivera: Don't obscure a tragedy to make a cheap political point.
    O'Reilly: If I'm the father ..
    Rivera: It's a cheap political point!
    O'Reilly: No, it isn't.
    Rivera: And you know it!
    O'Reilly: This is justice.
    Rivera: This has nothing to do with that poor old lady mayor.
    O'Reilly: And you want anarchy.
    Rivera: Has nothing to do with that mayor.
    O'Reilly: No. You want anarchy. You want open-border anarchy.
    Rivera: No. What I want ..
    
    3:50
    Rivera: But to take this tragedy in Virginia Beach, and make it about illegal aliens ..
    O'Reilly: It is.
    Rivera:  .. is a sin. That is a sin.
    O'Reilly: Bull. This family lured no one. This family lost their daughter.
    Rivera: Three hundred and forty-seven drunk driving fatalities in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans.
    Rivera: Do we care about them?
    O'Reilly: We deal with Americans that way. And I deal with it all the time.

    "A Georgetown University co-ed told Representative Nancy Pelosi's hearing that the women in her law school program are having so much sex they're going broke buying birth control pills.

    "Speaking at a hearing held by Pelosi to tout Obama's mandate that virtually every health insurance plan cover the full cost of contraception and abortion-inducing products, Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke said that it's too expensive to have sex in law school without mandated insurance coverage.

    "Apparently, four out of every ten co-eds are having so much sex that it's hard to make ends meet if they have to pay for their own contraception, said Sandra Fluke's research."

    Can you imagine if you were her parents, how proud of Sandra Fluke you would be? Your daughter goes up to a Congressional hearing conducted by the botox-filled Nancy Pelosi and testifies she's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them. Or the Pope.

    "Forty percent of the female students at Georgtown Law reported to us", said Sandra Fluke, "that they struggled financially as a result of this policy." The policy is Georgetown University's student insurance doesn't cover contraception. It costs a female student $3000.00 to have protected sex over the course of her three year stint in law school, according to the calculations. "Without insurance coverage, contraception as you know can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school," Fluke told the hearing. $3,000 for birth control in three years, that's a $1000 a year for sex and she wants us to pay for it.

    All of this just since January 7. Just since January 7. You guys who are thinking you're not going to go to college, let me just say one thing to you: Georgetown. They're admitting before a Congressional committee they're having so much sex they can't afford the birth control pills. That's all you've got to come up with. And all of this is the Republicans' fault.

    Susan Fluke, Fluke, one of the Butt Sisters being dragged out of law school by the hair. Wait 'til Rick Santorum hears about this.  Wait 'til Gingrich hears about this. What do you think he'll do. They'll put a stop to this right away. They'll head over to that university. They'll stop it. They'll spy on Susan Fluke and interrupt her in mid-coitus. And then they'll make them get married. Make 'em get married and make 'em have those babies, and make 'em have 10,000 babies and then stay home. Listening to the Troglodytes by the Jimmy Castor Bunch.

    What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex? What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us. We're the pimps, the johns. That's right. We will be the johns.

    No! We're not the johns. Well, err. That's right.  Pimp's not the right word. Ok, so she's not a slut. She's round-heeled, I take it back.

    Howard Stern: Because it's true about Jay. Jay had to sell Doritos. I mean, it's so true about him. Like he had enough money. It's like, when I see guys on radio who make good money, like fucking, fat Rush Limbaugh, selling on his website, every piece of shit, including Excellence In Broadcasting chair to his audience. Yeh, OK. Like some guy might say to me, Hey, what's wrong with that. If people want an Excellence In Broadcasting chair, why shouldn't Rush sell it. Because Rush makes enough money. Like you don't have to be a whore for everything.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, you understand Jackie selling his cups.
    Howard Stern: Right.
    Robin Quivers: Because he needs the money.
    Howard Stern: Right. Yeah, I know. When he was on our show, he was making a lot of money. 
    Robin Quivers: I'm talking about now.
    Howard Stern: Now he's got to sell a cup. He's one step from holding out a cup in the street. But the fact of the matter is that, you know, I see guys, like Rush Limbaugh, who supposedly has a house in Palm Beach.
    Robin Quivers: He's got a plane.
    Howard Stern: He's got his own private plane. He's looking to buy a football team. And he's still got to sell you his Excellence In Broadcasting key chains.
    Man: He's got it. He's loaded.
    Howard Stern: How about giving those dittoheads a key chain for free, you know.
    Robin Quivers: If you need somebody to be carrying around your emblem, give it to them.
    How Stern: And we are in show business, so there are certain things you have to sell. Like, for example, this service. I mean, it's not going to survive if there aren't subscribers. And there are things that you do sell. Maybe you write a book. Maybe not. I don't, I don't begrudge Rush Limbaugh
    Robin Quivers: How did he get into the chair business?
    Howard Stern: That's what I mean. I mean, why not just make .. He has Rush Limbaugh pies, I think. 
    Robin Quivers: Yes, He does. I think so.
    Howard Stern: Neckties, because look so spiffy. And don't sell the audience everything. You're not in the necktie business.

    01:24: Howard Stern: Okay. So let me explain something to you. The state of Hawaii, when someone is born, they don't issue a birth certificate. They issue a certificate that proves birth. But it's an abbreviated version. In other words, Obama didn't make this up. He didn't say, "I'm the only guy who was ever born in Hawaii who's going to have this abbreviated birth certificate. It's a birth certificate. It's legal. The man has been able to work. He's been able to carry on his life, having this birth certificate. It isn't the full birth certificate. This is what they issued everyone. Anyone born the same year as Obama got the same fucking thing. Everyone. So, why, if you have a half a brain, and you've got any kind of IQ or time on your hands, would you sit there and question it? In other words, what do you think, he got an abbreviated birth certificate on his own? He's the only guy who's ever born in Hawaii. Everyone who was born in Hawaii has the same stupid thing.
    Robin Quivers: Well, the whole idea is that Hawaii would go into collusion with him because they wanted a president from their state.
    Scott Depace: You're missing the point.
    Howard Stern: No, no. I haven't. I heard your point on the air. Here's .. I'll address your point. So he becomes president. And he hears .. Like if I became president, and I heard people saying, Well I don't believe Howard Stern was born in the United States, I wouldn't even pay attention to it. I'd be like, What, what the fuck are you talking about? And then, I'd go on and be the president.
    Scott Depace: It wasn't just a couple people saying it. They were passing laws in states that said he was going to have to produce it. It's huge.
    Howard Stern: Scott, this is ridiculous as anything. You don't .. If you're the president of the United States, and you're worried about A. I hope today I wake up, I hope, uh, I hope the economy doesn't crash. B. I hope I don't get assassinated.
    Scott Depace: You're wrong. You're so wrong. Howard, This thing was taken care of. Apparently, this thing was ..
    ...
    Howard Stern:  You know how many people believe in this country that we didn't land on the moon? So the president knows this. And he goes, How am I going to prove to those wack fucks out there that we did land on the moon.
    Scott Depace: Well apparently he did. 
    Howard Stern: How am I going to do it? How am I going to prove it to them. He didn't wake up saying, I'm going to prove to every conspiracy jerk-off, A. where I was born, B. that we landed on the moon. Like these imbeciles don't think Osama bin Laden's dead. Our military, God bless our military. I'll tell you why they're so smart. And why our president is smart. They took this ratfuck and threw him right in the ocean. Now, I'll tell you what. It alleviates all problems. You, do you know the nonsense that would be going on with these shitheads we're at war with if the body was still around? If it was laying somewhere. They would be carrying on. They would be like children tantruming. We wouldn't be able to stop the tantruming.
    Robin Quivers: It would be a call to action.
    Howard Stern: They took that body. They dumped it right in the fucking ocean. They aren't worried about whether you believe he is dead or not. The president didn't wake up and say, Oh, Donald Trump's going to tell me I didn't really kill Osama bin Laden.
    Robin Quivers: Yeah, the same people who've been questioning my birth certificate will question this.
    Howard Stern: You don't worry about that.
    Scott Depace: Now could I have a minute.
    Howard Stern: No. Yes. A minute with you is torture to me.
    Scott Depace: Well, you know what.
    Howard Stern: It's like waterboarding. It's like you're waterboarding when you talk. 
    Scott Depace: I need to get my own show.
    Howard Stern: You've got to get your own show. Because I heard you on the wrap-up show.
    Scott Depace: Listen, Howard. This happened before he became president. For one, it was questioned. Two, apparently he was able to ..
    Howard Stern. Scott, do you think the president cared?
    ...
    Scott Depace: Do you understand the significance of this, though. Imagine if he was not from this country, and he passed all these laws. Everything would have been null and void.
    Howard Stern: Ha, ha, ha, ha! You're a pisser. He's got a birth certificate.
    Scott Depace: Well, now he's got one. He showed it now.
    Howard Stern: He had it all along. They showed the thing that every citizen who's born in the United States in Hawaii gets. We landed on the moon. 
    Scott Depace: It's pretty simple to prove ...
    Howard Stern. You're out of your mind. My, you're out of your fucking mind. You should jump in the ocean with those ..
    Scott Depace: He should have done it, and it wouldn't have been a problem. I tell you, Right away.
    Scott Depace: Thank you. 
    Howard Stern. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in God?
    Scott Depace: Yes, I do.
    Howard Stern: Why? You can't see him. How do you know he's there?
    Scott Depace: It's called faith.
    Howard Stern: You have faith. Well, have faith the president is from the United States. Get out of here. Right now. Have faith. He has faith. Have faith in your president. Get out of here. You don't have faith? Well, guess what? He got the job done.
