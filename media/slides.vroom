== What we will be doing in this course

	* A listening course where the content is on
	the Internet and you have to COOPERATE and
	share information with 2 others. Like Dr Bean's
	CONVERSATION class.
	
	* A DISCUSSION with a competitor about a Taiwan
	news event. And a 3-way interaction with Dr
	Bean, informing him about the event. Like Dr
	Bean's SPEAKING class, the 2 groups decide on a
	winner.

	Who knows more about the event? Who can say
	more about it?
