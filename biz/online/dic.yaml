    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    To be successful, the website must be easy to find and good to look at. It must have good images and good information, technical information, about the things on sale. There needs to be clear information about prices and special offers. Information about delivery of the products is very important, too. Also the site must be fast and easy to navigate. It must be easy to find things on the site and it must be easy to order the goods and pay for them.

    If you have all these things, then customers will keep coming back.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Not everyone likes buying online, because they don't want to see a picture. They want to see the real thing. Some people feel insecure, handing over their money before getting the item. Other people like the experience of shopping, being seen, entering stores, seeing things and talking to store people.

    Every customer is an individual and different, at the same time as they are all similar. Customers who also like to use websites are also different. And even the same customer is different on different days. Sometimes they will look at the website and then go into a store. Sometimes they will order online.

    Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use their computers and the Internet to buy things. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

    Argos is a big retailer with many stores all over the U.K. which also has an online operation. It tries to integrate its two different forms of retailing, because its experience is that sometimes a customer will buy online and at other times the same customer will check the website to find information and then go into a store to buy the item. 

    So it has to understand, or try to recognize, what customers want to do on the site while they are still there. It also has to keep prices in its stores the same as prices for the same goods online.

      Have you ever bought anything online from Yahoo or Ruten, like clothes or CDs? Not everyone likes to use the Internet to shop. But shopping online is becoming more and more popular.

      The Internet is having a big influence on the retail market. Internet retailers can offer cut-throat prices because they do not have to run stores. Websites that publish comparisons of the prices on top online retailers make the market even more competitive.

      Some retailers who sell both online and in stores have tried to handle this problem by charging different prices for goods on their websites and in their stores.

      This dual pricing is becoming harder to practice as customers become better at surfing the Internet. Some people say retailers should integrate their operations so shoppers can buy online and pick up their purchases in stores.

    Interviewer: Argos sells good in its high-street stores and online. How do you run these operations successfully side by side?
    Indira: The key to our success is that we treat the customer as a single individual, and we don't treat customers as online customers or store customers. Our experience shows that customers will sometimes buy online, sometimes order on the telephone and sometimes go into the stores to pick up goods. So we need to understand what our customers want at any one time, or what our customers want depending on the product that they're buying, and serve those customers in the most appropriate way.
    In terms of our operation, our operations are fully integrated. The prices that we show on the website are identical to the prices that you would pay in the store.
    You can call up a call center and inquire about an order that you, you placed through any channel, whether that's the store, the website or the telephone. And if you buy something from the website and you don't like what you've got, you can return that item to a store.
    So running a multi-channel operation is the key to our success. We don't run operations side by side. We run a truly integrated multi-channel offer.

    Interviewer: What do you think are the keys to success in online selling?
    Indira: I think the, the most important thing is to understand that customers use websites for lots of different reasons. Some people are coming to a website to actually buy something on that day. Um, other people, uh, and a lot of people are coming to a website to acquire information either about a product, um, or about the retailer, um, and the key to selling online is to understand or recognize what the customer wants when they're on the website and try and provide that information.
    So the keys for us are providing good images and good information--technical information on all of the products that we sell; being very clear about the price of the product and any promotions that are running alongside those products; being very clear to the customer about what the delivery options are for each individual product; and then allowing them to find all of that information and then buy once they're ready.

    The key is to understand that not everybody wants to buy from a website.
    Um, and for us, a lot of our customers will, will research products online and then go to the store to pick that product up. Um, and so it's about understanding that customers online behave very similarly to customers on the high street. They come and browse, and then they think about it, and then they come back and buy. And again, it's going back to understanding that customers are people. They're not online customers or store customers. They're just customers, um, and they will want to do different things at different times. Um, so the key's making a site that is easy to navigate, easy to find, um, and easy to transact with. And if you can get those key things right, then customers will keep coming back to you.

    VanTine: Good afternoon. This is Laura VanTine, and today I'll be speaking with Maureen Stancik Boyce, IBM's Institute for Business Values distribution team leader about their IBV study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.  Welcome, Maureen.
    Stancik Boyce: Thanks Laura. I'm excited to talk about our study today, because there's a lot of great information. And I think can really help our clients in this economic environment. 
    VanTine: So let's start out with the general purpose of the study, Why Advocacy Matters to Online Retailers.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. The reason we did this study was to get deeper knowledge about consumers who shop online. We conducted a study of US consumers. And it was about twenty-five hundred consumers. We wanted to understand how they feel about their shopping experience. We also wanted to understand how strong is the customer support for their primary online retailer. So they might shop at multiple retailers, but we asked who do you shop at most often. And that's how we defined their primary online retailer.

    We also asked questions about what elements of the online customer experience were most important to the customers. We wanted to understand how well different online retailers were positioned, how good a job they're doing, and offering what the customer wants. And so we kind of ranked the different retailers across each other, how many advocates they do or do not have.

    We also wanted to understand what advocates look like, demographically, what's important to them, stuff like that, and how valuable they are.

    And finally we wanted to understand what actions an online retailer could take in order to gain more advocates.

    VanTine: Can you please explain a little bit more what you mean by advocacy?
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. And that is very important. So advocacy really is defined by three components. The first thing is, likelihood to recommend, the second is purchase intent, and the third is staying rate. And let me define each of those. So the first, likelihood to recommend. That's typical in any kind of CRM, or loyalty study, and that is, would a consumer recommend their primary retailer to family and friends. So that's the first criteria. So IBM has added two others that we feel really help define and show the difference between the casual advocate versus the true advocate.

    The second criteria is purchase intent. And that means a customer's willingness to purchase new products from their primary retailer that they normally buy elsewhere. So an example would be that an online retailer offers only clothes now, and if they started offering accessories, which they can't purchase currently, that they would in fact buy them, accessories, from that same retailer.

    And the third criteria that we used is staying rate. And that means if a new retailer opened up that offered similar products at a similar price point, would the consumer switch to the new retailer or would they stay with the current primary retailer. And if they would stay, they get a check mark in there at staying rate.

    So that anyone who might say yes to two or even one of the three criteria might be defined more as an apathetic. And those who say no to all of the three criteria would certainly be an antagonist, someone who does not like their primary retailer.

    VanTine: Why should retailers care so much if their shoppers are advocates or not?
    Stancik Boyce: Well, the key reason truly is financial. Advocates are more valuable customers. Our survey showed that on average, an advocate's share of wallet is actually thirty-three percent higher than the antagonist's. So they spend a lot more money. Advocates spend a lot more money with their primary retailer than do antagonists. Advocates' basket size is also greater. So they spend thirty percent more dollars with their primary retailer than do the antagonists. And then finally advocates are spending more over time. Sixty-five percent of advocates have increased the amount they're purchasing over the past two years. And conversely, there are fewer advocates have decreased their spending over time with their primary retailer, only four percent. The number is higher for antagonists at six percent.

    So in summary, advocates are more valuable becuase they spend a greater percent of their money online, and they spend more than other customers, than the antagonists and the apathetics. And they are increasing their spending over time. So the fact that they spend more and are more loyal, so they stay with their primary retailer longer, really their customer lifetime value is much higher than the average customer.

    VanTine: Since advocates are so valuable, do you have any insights into how retailers can build more advocates. For instance, can you explain what are the factors that drive advocacy and what may be the key areas that are so important to advocates.
    Stancik Boyce: Sure. That is actually an important part of our survey that we wanted to understand these factors.

    What we found out is that advocates really find convenience, customer service and the store, quote unquote, experience very important for online retailers. So let me explain a little bit more. What we did is, we asked survey respondents how they feel their primary retailer is doing on a list of statements that we call attributes. So, different parts of the shopping experience. We had a list of fifteen things and we asked the survey respondents, 'Does your primary retailer do this well?'

    That list of fifteen were bucketed into different areas and what we did then is analysis on what advocates were saying versus the apathetics versus the antagonists. And we found that advocates largely agreed that the store are doing things well. It was in the eighty, ninety percentile that they agreed that these attributes were done well by their primary retailer. Conversely, the antagonists and apathetics were much lower. Only twenty, thirty, maybe a couple of situations, forty percent of the antagonists were saying, 'Yes, my retailer does this well.' But what was interesting is that the rank ordering of the things that most people agreed well were in the same order, advocates and antagonists. So we said, Um, these are the most important attributes. It's just that the antagonists are not getting them from their primary retailer.

    So what we found was the absolute top-rated attribute was, 'My online retailer makes it easy to shop.' So that is bucketed into convenience. We said, that's an attribute that really is related to convenience.

    The second highest-rated attribute was, 'I'm happy with the service I receive from online store employees.' So even though a consumer was not in the store, the customer service, when they need help, they want to be able to get help. The consumer wants the help from somebody at the store. Customer service is second in importance.

    And then third we found the statement, 'It was pleasant and enjoyable to shop at this online retailer.' That was the attribute rated third most important.

    Michelle: Let's talk about the time for setting up the website. We want it ready in a month's time. That's the end of July.
    Larry: It's a bit early. I was hoping to have two months to do the job. If I finish in one month, will you agree to reduce the number of pages?
    Michelle: Yes, that's not problem. Just do the best you can. Our priority is to have the website up and running as soon as possible.
    Larry: Okay, then. Agreed.
    Michelle: Now, about payment. You want to charge us fifty dollars an hour. That works out at 400 hundred dollars a day, I believe.
    Larry: Yes. That's the normal fee for the job.
    Michelle: Well, we'd prefer to pay a fixed amount for the work. We can offer you 6,000 dollars.
    Larry: I see. Do you mind if I ask you why you want to pay that way?
    Michelle: Well, you see that way we can control the cost of the project. If we pay you per hour, the cost could become high. It could get out of control. This way, we know where we stand.
    Larry: I see. 6,000 dollars. Mmh, that could be all right, I suppose, as long as I get some money in advance. How about paying me half when I start the work and half at the end?
    Michelle: Yes. I think we could arrange that. Okay, I agree to that.
    Larry: Now, the design of the website. Will we have book covers on it?
    Michelle: Absolutely. I'd like to display a large number of book covers on every page. They really attract people's attention. What do you think?
    Larry: It's a bit too much, I'd say. A lot of pictures take too long to download. I'd prefer one big image. How about that?
    Michelle: Mmh. I don't know. People like to see the book covers. It draws them into the website, believe me.
    Larry: Maybe you're right. How about two covers per page, then.
    Michelle: Okay. That sounds reasonable. Now, what else do we need to discuss before you get started?

    You, together with B, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
    You want the website operating within one month. The quicker it is up, the better. But you realize the designer needs time to develop the site.
    You want the website to have lots of information and different links that the user can click.
    You want to pay the designer 6,000 dollars. This seems a reasonable amount of money. You think if you offer less than this, the designer won't be willing to do it, or won't do a good job.
    You want to pay the designer when the site is finished and operating, so you can be sure it works and is acceptable.
    You would like the site to show individual images of all the covers of the books that the bookstore sells. Images are always more interesting than text. They give the reader an idea of what the book is like.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them are not negotiable. You aren't willing to compromise on them. B has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will C and D accept your position?

    You, together with A, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
    You are not willing to compromise on the time that A said. The site is very important to doing business. You are ready to send books to buyers, but the only way the buyers can contact you or even know you are doing business is through the web site. The quicker the site is up, the better.
    You are not concerned about the amount of information on the site just now. You are ready to negotiate the number of pages and links on the site. In fact, any amount is okay.
    You are not willing to pay more than the price A said. It is a fixed price which you can't negotiate.
    You are ready to compromise on when the designer is paid, perhaps some in advance before the designer starts work, and some after the site is up and working.
    A told C and D what Michelle wants in terms of the number of images and the amount of text on the site, but she is willing to compromise on this. She realizes that changes can be made later.
    You don't have to change your position if C and D will accept what A said. But if they don't, you will have to negotiate some of those requirements. Which offers will C and D find unacceptable? And will C and D accept your new position?

    You want to take two months to get the website up and operating. Your reason it you have a lot of other work to do and you want to do a good job on Michelle's site, even though you realize she wants it up quickly.
    You want to limit the amount of information on the website and the different links that the user can click. Michelle probably will want the site redesigned, and a simpler design will make redesigning easier. It will also be quicker to finish a simpler design.
    You want to charge Michelle fifty dollars an hour. This seems a reasonable amount of money. It's the normal fee for the job.
    You want to limit the size of the site. Rather than individual images of all the covers of all the books that the bookstore sells, you want to have bigger images of a few of the popular books. This will mean users don't have to wait so long to see the images.
    You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them may not be negotiable. You may not be willing to compromise on them. D has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will A and B accept your position?

    The designer is ready to agree the site be finished in a shorter time than the time C said he/she wanted to take. For example, he/she would be willing to have it ready in one month. But this would require some compromise by Michelle on the size of the site and the amount of information.
    The designer is willing to incorporate Michelle's ideas into the design of the website, together with your ideas.
    The designer is willing to be paid a fixed price rather than the way A mentioned. But in return, he/she would want half of the fee to be paid in advance, before starting work.
    C told A and B about the problem of images. The designer however is willing to compromise on images, perhaps one or two images of individual covers of books on each page.

    Length of contract: Lifetime wants the contract to be for three years. There is uncertainty about whether the venture will be successful or not.
    Range of destinations: It wants the destinations to be only in the Mediterranean. This is the area where it is losing market share.
    Car hire and insurance: It does not want these to be part of the venture. People who want these probably will not order online.
    Advertising: It wants to invest 100,000 dollars in advertising on a fifty-fifty basis. Direct probably has its own ideas about advertising so it should use its own money to try those ideas out.
    Structure: It wants to manage the project because it has greater management experience and knowledge.
