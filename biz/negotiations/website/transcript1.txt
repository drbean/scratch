You, together with B, are negotiating for Michelle, who is setting up an online bookstore. On the other hand, C and D are negotiating on behalf of the website designer. They represent the designer.
You want the website operating within one month. The quicker it is up, the better. But you realize the designer needs time to develop the site.
You want the website to have lots of information and different links that the user can click.
You want to pay the designer 6,000 dollars. This seems a reasonable amount of money. You think if you offer less than this, the designer won't be willing to do it, or won't do a good job.
You want to pay the designer when the site is finished and operating, so you can be sure it works and is acceptable.
You would like the site to show individual images of all the covers of the books that the bookstore sells. Images are always more interesting than text. They give the reader an idea of what the book is like.
You are willing to negotiate some of these requirements. But some of them are not negotiable. You aren't willing to compromise on them. B has the details. So, how will you change your position? And will C and D accept your position?
