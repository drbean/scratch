B: Price is how much the customer pays for the clothes. The higher the price, the more money Uniqlo might make. But the higher the price, the less likely it is that the customer will decide to buy the clothes. Uniqlo also has to know how much the clothes cost to make.

Uniqlo products are medium-priced. Uniqlo decided they want to sell to people who want to show they are successful when they wear their clothes.

Promotion also includes the style of its public image, the look of Uniqlo stores, Uniqlo packaging and the Uniqlo logo.
