I can't focus on my work, because of the environment. I don't have my own space. I feel like I'm homeless, living in the street. 

Oh, I have a chair and a desk, but I have to share it. And there are always people I don't know walking past me. It is crowded and there are three other people, all in the same area, without even a window.

It's also very noisy with five telephones always ringing, people shouting, and others interrupting me. 

The computers and the air conditioning are noisy too, when they're not broken. Often it's too hot in the office to work.

And of course, I don't have my own computer. I have to share one with the three other people. I wish they wouldn't download all those files they do. The computer has lots of viruses, of course.

I think I deserve my own office. But I don't get the treatment I deserve from the company, I think.
