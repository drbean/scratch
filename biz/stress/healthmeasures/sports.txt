To reduce stress here at the company, I think it's important that everyone be involved in a lot of physical activity, like jogging, or swimming, or basketball.

It would be nice to have our own basketball court and swimming pool, but that would be very expensive.

Instead, I think we should talk to the manager of the local sports center and arrange a group membership for everyone at the company. That would probably also be expensive, but the sports center has a good pool and a sauna.

I think a lot of workers would enjoy a swim at lunch time or after work. The sauna is also very relaxing.

And I'm sure their basketball court would be very popular. Even now, many people here are members of the sports center, and they use the basketball court during the lunch hour or after work.

They also have a weight room, where people can use exercise machines.
