I think the best thing to improve the health and well-being of our staff is to improve the food in the company cafeteria. Generally, the food here isn't healthy. If someone just ate the food available in the company cafeteria, they wouldn't be getting a balanced diet. There is too much fatty, salty, starchy and sweet food and not enough fish, fruit and vegetables.

And the food here is not good for people's stress levels. You know how drinking coffee or coke can make you feel more tense and excited? That's stress. And reasearch has shown that fatty, salty, starchy and sweet foods also raise people's stress levels.

To reduce these levels, we need to have more natural foods, like fish, fruit and vegetables, in the cafeteria. Perhaps they don't taste so good as the food we have now, but people will feel more relaxed and will live better lives.
