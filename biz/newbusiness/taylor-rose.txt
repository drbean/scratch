Transcript: Business planning and attracting finance

   [14]<< Back to podcasts

   [Interviewer] Hello, and welcome to this podcast brought to you by
   Business Link. Business Link is the free government funded
   multi-channel support service for businesses of all sizes, from
   start-up to succession.

   In this podcast we asked Anthony Taylor-Rose for advice and guidance on
   business planning and attracting finance. LloydsTSB is one of the UK's
   biggest banks. Anthony has worked for Lloyds for thirty years and is a
   Commercial Area Director. Anthony's team look after business clients
   with turnover of up to 15 million pounds.

   Anthony, when starting up a new business, how do you work out how much
   money you actually need?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] That's a very good question. Initially you need
   to look at the start up costs, as distinct to the running costs.
   Because obviously when a business is first formed, there are a number
   of costs to get the thing going. For example, are you going to work
   from home? Are you going to have business premises? Do you need
   equipment? Have you got to buy stock? And all of these issues are very
   important before you even get going.

   There are hidden costs of course, which sometimes people forget when
   they're starting running a business. For example legal expenses, if
   you're setting up, if you need a trade name or a business name, there
   can be a lot of legal costs.

   There may need to be sign painting for your premises, for your vehicle.
   And all these things you don't readily agree and remember at the outset
   are the right costs, but they are there and you need to know them.

   Security costs in the current climate are very, very important -
   alarms, locks, window locks - because you want to secure your own
   assets that you've put in.

   Invariably, you'll need some form of computerisation in the current
   climate, be it stock control, or control of your debtors, keeping wages
   details, so to keep a control of all of your things, you normally will
   have some form of computer costs. Now you may have your own laptop to
   start with, but invariably you need to get extra software onto that to
   get it running. That may require you to a have a maintenance contract.
   There maybe training costs. And so these are quite often overlooked
   when you start to run a business.

   [Interviewer] What about insurance?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] Yes, insurance is another big one. With public
   liability, you need that if you're on your own. Certainly for employing
   people your employer's liability, you need, and key, personal insurance
   for yourself.

   If you are running the business and you are the key person in that
   business, that business relies on you as an individual, so you are
   essential to it; and don't forget you are different in law to the
   limited company that you're forming. So you need to have insurance for
   yourself because you are a key employee. All of this, of course, can be
   brought together in a business plan.

   [Interviewer] Ok, so we've worked out how much money we're going to
   need, how do you now go about preparing a business plan?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] Well there's a very good saying that I often use,
   "that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail".

   It's absolutely vital in my mind that you have to write something down.
   Do it in clear, straightforward language. Have a general background
   details to the business: what you're trying to achieve. Make clear when
   you've found the business, highlight any achievements you've already
   had, which are important because that demonstrates experience and
   knowledge.

   A secondary part, but equally important part, of the business plan, is
   the financial aspect. These will include your monthly profit and loss
   forecast and your cashflow forecast. Both of these are vital. Cash is
   the key one: you need to get control of your cash. Cash is key. Without
   having the cash in your business it will not succeed.

   The business plan, whilst written in simple language, needs to be
   flexible, because it will need to be read by a number of different
   audiences, not just from a banking point of view, but clients will
   probably look at it, prospective clients, suppliers. So you'll need to
   have that broadly written to cover a range of audiences.

   [Interviewer] Ok, Anthony, but what specific areas of business would
   this finance be needed for?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] There are different finances for different
   circumstances and you need to just plan that as part of your thought
   process in your business plan. For example, you may look for
   straightforward banking support, so that's an overdraft or a loan.

   A further variation on that is that you can, if you've got a good sales
   ledger, you can have that discounted. And the old-fashioned terms would
   have been 'factoring', but in the modern day climate we refer to
   'invoice discounting', so we discount your invoices.

   There is leasing and hire purchase, for various assets that you're
   looking to acquire or need for the business. You may even want to go
   into partnership, so you may even sell some of the shares in the
   business to a partner, who can either be positive and with you, or a
   sleeping partner, and they can invest cash which helps you get up and
   running.

   There are a whole range of grants - local grants, government grants -
   that can help provide finance upfront. So there are many, many
   different sources of finance and you will need to explore that with all
   of your financial advisers. [Interviewer] Then how do you work out how
   much you actually need?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] Well this basically is going back to the business
   plan and the financial aspects of the business plan. If you're in a
   position to borrow, consider getting more than you need.

   And that might sound a funny comment, coming from a banker, but it's
   always important that you've got enough finance. There's nothing worse
   than going down your business plan and three months in thinking 'Gosh,
   I'm running short of cash, where am I going?' You need all your
   energies to focus on running that business.

   So really make sure you've covered all those hidden costs and running
   costs that we spoke about in an earlier question. And make sure that
   you've borrowed enough to cover you for a margin and a buffer for
   unforeseen circumstances. [Interviewer] Ok Anthony, but what specific
   areas of business would this finance be needed for?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] I think it's important that you look at the class
   of assets. So if you're buying fixed assets, that could be machinery,
   plant machinery, you need to think about funding that over the life of
   that asset.

   Working capital, so the day to day paying of your creditors, paying
   your staff wages, paying your costs is important and that's where an
   overdraft comes in.

   So you need to make sure you match the class of the finance with the
   class of the requirement that you have. That's very, very critical.

   [Interviewer] So we've thought about how much money we're going to need
   to start this business up. We've thought about a business plan. We've
   thought about finance and how much we need to raise. It's time to go to
   the bank. What should we actually physically take with us and how
   should we conduct ourselves in that meeting?

   [Anthony Taylor-Rose] Well at the very least, of course, you need the
   business plan that we've spoken about before. That is essential because
   that describes your vision. That describes what you want to achieve.
   That will list what you have achieved in terms of experience. So at the
   very least you do need your business plan with you.

   Be confident. You've probably thought about this idea for a long, long
   time, so be confident, but not over confident. Make sure that you
   present a warm picture of what you're looking to achieve. Be positive
   in it, but not over positive.

   If you've got any pre-orders, that's very, very useful to bring along,
   because it evidences that you are actually already off and running and
   that you've got some clients either firmly with orders, or clients that
   are initially pre-order stage. So this gives confidence that your
   business will actually get off the ground and it's not just a pipe
   dream or words on a page.
