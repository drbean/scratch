A year ago, two marine equipment manufacturers, Muller and Peterson joined to form a large company, MPM. The Muller and Peterson sales teams were put together, and the Muller Sales Manager, that is, A, became Sales Manager of the new team and Peterson's Sales Manager, that is, you, became Deputy Sales Manager.
The ideas of the two sales teams were very different. A meeting is going to be held to decide how the two teams can work together more effectively. A, as Sales Manager, will lead the meeting, and you, as Deputy Sales Manager, will help him/her.  It is your job to listen to the sales people's opinions and to agree on a plan which will improve the atmosphere in the department and help staff to work together more effectively.
IMPORTANT NOTE: In fact, you are impressed more by the Peterson sales representatives. You think they have a more positive attitude. You think their efficiency and good customer service are important for the future success of the company.
