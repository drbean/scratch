Oliver and conflict at European campers:
"Good managers get everyone to think the same things."
"Oliver is not happy with the way Jacques deals with his orders,"
"Oliver lets Jacques get his commission and bonus."
"Oliver wants Todd to let him do everything his way."
"Oliver wants more discipline and control from Todd."
"Todd wants to meet Oliver's buyers, to make sure he can keep them if Oliver leaves."
"Todd wants Oliver to leave the company."

Nicholson's advice:
  - The manager should try to find people who agree with the other team and don't agree with their team.
  - Nicholson's advice to Charles is to fight with Todd and Oliver.
  - The manager needs to think if he (or she) understands the motivation of the different persons.
  - The manager really needs to think the same about the different teams.
  - Nicholson's advice is to think of the company as a system and understand that if everyone understands the system, it will work at its best,
  - Both Oliver and the Muller sales team understand that all parts of the system are important but that producing the product is more important than selling it.
  - The Peterson sales team realizes that it is part of a system that depends on other systems.
  - The Peterson sales team understands that it is the most important part of the system.
