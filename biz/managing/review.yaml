  A: Everyone is different. So the good manager has to be good at looking into your heart and your head, and understanding you. The manager has to ask the right questions and listen carefully. Also the good manager knows everyone is also the same. Everyone is concerned about their families, wants to do a good job, and wants to be respected.
  B: People are working harder and harder nowadays. Managers expect people to do more and more in less and less time. But because people are working so hard, they don't have time to think about their goals. People must think more about what they are doing and why they are doing it. They must think more about their part in the system.
  C: Everyone in Taiwan looks the same and speaks the same language, so you don't realize they think differently. When you go overseas for the first time, you understand Taiwanese think differently. But actually everyone is different. Every Taiwanese is different. Every foreigner is different. The different people are important. The different countries are less important.
  D: The company had some good ideas but no-one knew a woman in the company thought of them first. The boss told everyone they were his ideas. The woman was unhappy. Next time, when she has a good idea, she should tell her boss she wants to help him. She should then ask him to help her by saying the idea is hers.

  A: The Sales Manager thinks the Muller sales reps are better sales people because their main aim is to sell as much as possible. The manager likes that they are very competitive and they put a lot of pressure on customers. He likes that they are happy with the low basic salary and high commissions. He doesn't like the Peterson sales team because it doesn't do this.
  B: The Assistant Sales Manager likes the Peterson sales reps better because they build better customer relationships. Customers trust them. The sales reps do not pressure them and they share information about them with each other by writing good reports. He doesn't like the Muller sales team because it doesn't share information and its sales reports are not good.
  C: Bad things about the Muller sales team are its promises of early delivery dates, even if the company cannot meet the date. This is lying to customers and they complain. It also doesn't share information with other reps. Its reports are useless to them. It gives individual buyers expensive gifts and so relationships with customers are not open and fair.
  D: Bad things about the Peterson sales team: It's not enthusiastic about making sales. It wants higher salaries and bonuses if sales targets are met. It's not competitive. It does not promise early delivery dates. It does not put any pressure on customers at all. It does not make as much money for the company as the Muller sales team.

  A: Charles is the CEO of the camping equipment company. Todd, the marketing manager, and Oliver, a salesman. are fighting. Charles wants Todd and Oliver to stop fighting, but he doesn't know what to do. Todd is right, and Oliver is wrong, but he doesn't want to make Oliver unhappy. He doesn't want Oliver to leave the company, because he is a very good salesman.
  B: Jack, the production manager doesn't like Oliver. Oliver just thinks about what he wants, rather than what is good for the company. He promises delivery dates to customers that are impossible. He expects Jack to produce the products in time. Jack cannot do this. Jack wants him to leave the company. Jack is unhappy that Charles and Todd don't fire Oliver.
  C: Oliver is a super salesman. He loves selling to customers. He has decided to leave the company, because Jack and Todd do not respect his hard work. He can get orders, but the company cannot take the orders, because Jack does not try to increase production. Todd only tries to control him. Todd makes him write useless reports and telephone messages.
  D: Todd is the manager of the sales team. He thinks Oliver may be hurting the company. He only thinks about his own job, not about what other people have to do. He doesn't help the other sales people by telling them about his customers. Todd thinks he may want to leave the company and set up his own company. Todd doesn't want him to leave the company.

  A: To help the 2 different teams work together, Nicholson says the manager must find things which the 2 teams agree about, for example, the desire to do a good job. Then the manager can help them agree about other things, for example, the need to work together. The manager needs to find people who think differently to the others. These people might agree with the other team.
  B: Nicholson says managers must examine their own and the other people's motivation. Todd, the marketing manager needs to understand why Oliver wants to be a super salesman. But he also needs to understand why he wants to control Oliver. He needs to understand why Oliver thinks differently than him. He needs to ask himself: Am I wrong? Is Oliver right.
  C: Nicholson says the Muller sales team aren't able to see their job of marketing as part of the company system. They just think about selling the product and not about the connection with production. They don't realize that the company is a system. Everyone needs to cooperate. Everyone needs to have all the information, so that the system works well.
  D: Nicholson says the Peterson sales team understands the systems view. It understands it is part of a system. It also understands the company is part of a larger system with customers and other companies. It may not understand it is the most important part of the system. It must understand its contacts with customers make the company a success or a failure.
