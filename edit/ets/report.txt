Design 2 report
This road is a farmers' market which features multiple races. I was particularly interested in understanding why the tents displaying the market’s name are mostly red. When designing the map, I noticed there are two important colors in the market- red and white; in addition, blue white stripes are also popular. Later on, I found an online article discussing that unifying the color of sheds in the market can stimulate business. Is it true? To analyze the question, I designed a cute kraft board questionnaire for market survey. I discovered that the conclusion of the online article is not true and found that some stores are distinguishingly popular because of their competitive price and quality. I chose to interview a famous meet stand, fish stand, egg stand and rock music stand which always attracts customers by interesting music. I decided to design a guide book and APP to introduce these high value vendors, and use the features of white, red, blue/white sheds and vintage design with hand-drawn map. On the map, I have put some commodity figures, such as chicken, egg, fish and meat to make it more interesting. I hope that through my questionnaire and interview, more authentic stories and good vendors can be introduced to attract local residents. I was rejected 3 to 4 times before collecting those data. I have been brainstorming how to make the guide book interesting and a user-friendly APP to introduce these vendors; thus I combined feature sheds, pictures and photos to delivery my idea. At the end of the book, I additionally introduce a small park nearby; it is an art city with frequent free activities for residents to participate. 
Additionally, I design a book cover for the book. When I did research and questionnaire on the street, I found a couple selling fabrics for a long time in the market. The prices of the fabrics are reasonable, and there are a variety of fabrics to choose from. Although there are other fabric shops on the street, after comparison, I still recommend the store I introduce in my guidebook.
I bought a piece of fabric while I was in this store. I hope the vintage white color of the fabric matches my book. The cover is made in with the pattern of a shack which is made of all kinds of materials including fabrics and classic curves in different lines. 
Although the locals might come to the market every week, they might not know where they can buy things at the most reasonable prices. Therefore, I did this research in order to introduce them to the butcher's shop, fish shop, fabric shop, egg shop, CD stores, and free cultural center that are worth visiting. I also attach my questionnaire to the book, showing why the locals choose certain shops an d whether they think the shack improve the business. The whole book presents the feeling of a traditional market.
