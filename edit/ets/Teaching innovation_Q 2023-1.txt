Teaching for Enhancing Innovation Ability Using Q-technique

This study was to confirm the Q-technique instruction effect of enhancing the innovation ability of students. The focus group and quasi-experimental method were applied. First of all, the innovation ability was confirmed by experts to be a professional competency required by enterprises. Next, the Q-technique unit instruction and experiment designed to verify the instruction effect of cultivating students with the innovation ability. It was discovered that the innovation ability was composed of eight indices, and the Q-technique can upgrade the students’ innovation ability. In the application in practice, the Q-technique can attain the integral learning in a systematic manner from the creativity till the innovative products in technology; to suffice the deficiency in innovation ability literatures of the “process perspective”. In the aspect of contribution, the Q-technique can be applied to innovative instructions and the changes of mental models, valuable to the reform of innovation teaching. 
Keywords: IT enterprise, professional competency, curriculum, Q-technique.

Introduction
How to reduce the difference between the innovation ability requirements of enterprises and the cultivation curriculum shall be an important issue in employability (Støren & Aamodt, 2012). Through higher education, the difference between the work requirements and the competences of employers can be shortened, in order to reduce the occurrence ratio in the difference between job requirements and education results (Green et al, 2002). The industry demand oriented professional competency shall be an important basis for the curriculum innovation. Therefore, through a continued innovation in curriculum, and successive focusing on the professional competency requirements, the employability of the students can then be upgraded, and the education and service compliance of the graduated students be promoted (Li, Yen, & Cheng, 2008；Chang & Chang, 2011). 
It is pointed out in the previous studies that the innovation ability is one of the important indices of information employability (Chang, 2014), and already forms one of the important competencies required by contemporary IT enterprises (Ehrenmann & Warschat, 2013). The so-called innovation refers to creativity plus the market application (Ettlie, 2000). In other words, to upgrade the innovation, it is still required to trace the source of the inspiration in creativity. Next, the creative result shall be further marketized, to facilitate the ideas to generate its market value. Concerning the integration of the studies of past literatures in creativity, its approaches can be summarized to be oriented from such several studies as the influence perspective, the structure perspective,  process perspective and consequentialism, etc. (Chang, 2013). Concerning the influence perspective among the above, for example, Piffer (2012) defines the relativity of creativity and products to be higher than the relativity to human beings. Concerning the structure perspective, for example, Gruys, Munshi, & Dewett (2011) think only with the novel and value generation can be considered to be provided with creativity. Concerning the process perspective, the studies concentrate on the application of brainstorming to generate ideas, procedures, actions or behaviors in creativity (Drazin, et al., 1999). The consequentialism points out that the result of creativity is closely related to marketability (Duke & Mount, 1996). As the performance of creativity is highly related to the market demand, it conforms to the true implication of the creativity dealing with the industrial and academic requirements. However, from the creativity study approach of the process perspective, two major problems are encountered. The first problem is that during the past studies, the “process perspective” concerns about the production process of creativity (Drazin, et al., 1999; Gomes, Kruglianskas, & Scherer，2011), but without any special concern about the systematic learning generated from creation till marketization. The second problem is that the transition in technology is rapid, yet the cultivation of innovation ability is in lack of a learning method with high operability to fit to a learner’s technical life experience, and further inspire the performance in high creativity through recognition, identification till the changes of mental models. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, it is necessary to find out an effective learning method, to aid a learner to attain a comprehensive learning process from the generation of ideas -> the result of innovation -> the marketization process. 
In order to attain the cultivation of this “innovation ability”, the Q- technique is introduced in this study to serve as the instruction method of creativity. The purpose of this study was to confirm the Q-technique instruction effect of enhancing the students’ innovation ability. The major difference between it and other studies is that, it particularly emphasizes on the recognition, identification till the changes of mental models in the innovation key factors of technology products. The contribution of the study is that the learning of Q-technique method can improve the performance of students of IT field in innovation ability. It verifies the Q-technique can be applied to the innovative instructions, contributing reference values to the reform of innovation teaching.
Index in Innovation Ability
The innovation ability required by the industry, from the viewpoint of the competence-based theory, refers to that the employers shall be provided with the innovation ability required to engage in IT works, in order to be able to create high talents added values to IT enterprises (Chang & Chang, 2014). Under the guidance of this theory, creativity and the expressed innovation have already been the mandatory professional competencies of IT personnel (Baytiyeh, 2012). Concerning the “innovation ability”, this study has its approach through the process perspective, by applying the viewpoints provided by Amabile (1983). That is: to consider the creativity to be an interaction of an individual in the internal mechanism, or the performance of an interaction of an individual with the external environment. 
In order to explore the innovation ability upgrading effect, the confirmation of its composition index in priority shall be necessary (Chang, 2013). Ehrenmann and Warschat (2013) indicate that uncertainties, enable flexibility and adaptability are essential properties of the innovation ability. Besemer & Treffinger (1981) conclude 14 indices to judge innovation, each separately attributing to three aspects: (1) novelty (originality, ingenuity, convertibility); (2) problem solving (adequacy, relevance, logicality, utilizable, and valuable); (3) elaboration and comprehensiveness (attractive, complicated, extremely good, manifesting, system organizational, tactful). Chang (2014) points out the essential properties of innovation ability can be concluded to be such eight items as: (1) sensitivity of a problem, (2) organizational integration, (3) complexity, (4) originality, (5) flexibility (6) novelty (7) fluency and (8) creative impulse, etc. Piffer (2012) thinks creativity includes three dimensions, i.e., novelty, appropriateness and impact. Therefore, by integrating the indices, definitions and topic distribution of innovation ability obtained from the journals, they are shown as in the following Table 1.

Methodology
Focus Group method: It has been conducted for three times in total. Total 24 experts in the industrial and academic fields are invited to perform a joint discussion and study; among them 18 ones come from ICT as junior and senior managers, and 6 ones are scholars. The objective of the meeting mainly is to confirm the “innovation ability” is one of the professional competencies required by IT enterprises, and the rationality of each index. Next, it attempts to revise the pre-test and post-test scales; review the rationality of the design of instruction activities; and check the feasibility of an instruction/learning mode, etc. 
Quasi-experimental
Design of an experiment: Taking the senior students of the IT Management Department of a certain technology university in Taiwan as the target, by means of purposive sampling, 44 students each of the experimental group and the baseline group are selected, to facilitate the experimental group to receive the “Q-technique instruction mode” (i.e., X1), and the baseline group to receive the “general instruction mode” (i.e., C), in the traditional lecture manner as the main instruction type as table2. The same teaching material is used, to engage in instructions for total 8 weeks, with 2 hours for each week. 9 teams are divided in each class, with 4-5 people in each team. The assignment done shall be in a group manner, to be handed in the class on the occasion.

Remarks: X1 refers to involvement in the experiment; C refers to the control treatment; Y1 refers to the pre-test scale; Y2 refers to the post-test scale.

Development of the Pre-test Scale and Post-test Scale: Taking the content perspective of eight “innovation abilities” as the basis, prepare the pre-test scale and post-test scale in accordance with the behavioural events method of Dessler (2007), to serve as the evaluation tools in the instruction experiment. For each topic, the Likert Scale5-point design (1=not important, 5=very important) is applied. The topic distribution of each index is shown as in Table 3. 
Data Analysis: In the first stage, a covariance analysis is applied to engage in the verification of the effect of an experiment instruction. It is attempted to check if the difference between both the experimental group and baseline group reaches a significant level. As to the analysis, the pre-test scores before learning are taken as the covariance, under different instruction modes as independent variables; while the post-test scores after learning are taken as dependent variables, to inspect the instruction effect of the Q-technique unit instruction. In the second stage, a factor analysis shall be conducted in terms of the post-test results; the obtained Q factors represent a kind of hypothesis attitude (Lo, 1985). The objective is to base on the characteristic value to serve as a criterion to judge the strength/weakness of the attitude of each topic factor, in order to understand the level of promoting each index of innovation ability through the innovation ability instruction by means of the Q-technique, and interpret the mental mode changes of the learners. 

Implementation
Design of instruction activity
Taking the “Innovation Ability Application of the Q-technique” to be the instruction unit. The instruction shall be fulfilled in accordance with three procedures. That is (1) the cultivation of “innovation ability” shall serve as the instruction objective, (2) design a group assignment topic, and (3) implement the instruction (including pre-test and post-test). The instruction/learning objectives shall be shown as in the following Table 3.

Able to seek for answers in accordance with the technique and procedure of the Q-technique, demonstrate and report the results. 
In a supportive environment, able to perform a better market sensitivity and fluency, and flexible thinking ability. 

Q-technique Instruction Design
The Q-technique was a kind of method specializing in studying the subjectivity of human beings, able to be referred to as Q-method, Q-technique, Q-sort (Barbosa et al., 1998). It can be defined that a subject by means of his own pointed statement of opinion, for him to define the attitude as a kind in combination of qualitative and quantitative research method (Dennis & Goldberg, 1996). The goal of applying Q-technique is to, after completing the construction of Q population through brainstorming, select the Q sample through group discussions; and perform ordering concerning the statement sentences of the Q sample, to acquire the priority order of the innovation content items. The design of teacher/student activity had shown as Table 4.

Results & Discussion
The application of Q-technique with adequacy
The application of Q-technique to the instruction of innovation ability shall be provided with adequacy. Concerning the implementation of Q-technique, it integrates the application of brainstorming; similarly as the manner of KJ method in generating innovation (Kunifuji & Kato, 2007), sharing the same principle through different expressions. 
During the instruction process, it is required to through the activity practice attain the active learning and participating into the “doing” process of the students as a conscious recognition (Burton, Schlemer, & Vanasupa, 2012). Substantially speaking, the difference of Q-technique from the traditional instruction mainly deals with its catalyzing the ideas identification of students, and hence promoting the generation of innovation. Through the recognition of innovation and the upgrading of the thinking ability of an individual, it incurs a change in mental model. The application of Q-technique to the instruction of ingenuity conforms to the viewpoints of Drazin, et al., (1999); Gomes, Kruglianskas, and Scherer (2011) concerning the process perspective in creativity. 
In additions, the application of Q-technique to the instruction of innovation conforms to the instruction concept of the scientific creation thinking (Burton, Schlemer, & Vanasupa, 2012), also conforms to the group dynamics addressed by Cole and Faota (2005), and the systematic approach of the argument in mental model (Capelo & Dias, 2009). In other words, its emphasis deals with the mutual knowledge sharing in a group discussion; it helps to break through the personal thinking framework, change the thinking habit, and further promote the generation of creativity.
Instruction effect of the Q-technique
Concerning the reliability and validity test in a test scale, the Content Validity is conducted by experts for its draft, to check if the scale content sufficiently reflects the substantial essence. Concerning the reliability of the scale, the entire Cronbach α=0.958, while the Cronbach α of each topic ranges between 0.956~0.960, all attaining a high reliability. It shows there is a high accordance inside the topic respondents. Concerning the examination of homogeneity for the regression coefficient in a group, the results as F=.307, p=.581>.05, both showing failing to be significant, indicating the slopes of regression line of both groups to be the same, conforming to the homogeneity of the regression coefficient assumptions in the covariance group. The covariance analysis is conducted continuously. Concerning the results of the Tests of Between-Subjects Effects, F value =13.724; p=.000<.001. It shows after eliminating the influence of the pre-test performance record, the treatment effect of the experiment is significant. That is, the learning performance record of the experimental group after applying the instruction by means of Q-technique is obviously better than that of the baseline group.

Priority ordering of indices of innovation ability
The 17 items with distribution in the positive side are highly regarded, as shown in Fig. 1.  Concerning the distribution of items for the innovation ability content, it shows the instruction units of innovation ability, the priority order in the positive group from high to low are: +3 groups (d19、c14、f30), +2 groups (f31、c13、g36、d22、g35、b10), +1 group (e29, h42, b11, e24, g39, a1, a5, c12). After a further analysis is conducted for the attributed indices of innovation ability, three items each for complexity and fluency are acquired as the maximum, next to it are two items each concerning originality, novelty, market sensitivity, organizational integration, and flexibility, etc. Its result in general conforms to the originally set experimental instruction objective.

Q-technique in promoting innovation ability
The scales shall not serve for the analysis of the covariance of learning effect only; the data obtained from the post-test scale also through a factor analysis interprets the factor characteristics (Barbosa et al., 1998). Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (Approx. Chi-Square) = 1118.992, df =435, p<.01, confirming each perspective to be close to the normal multivariate; and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy, KMO=.801. Therefore, it is adequate to perform a factor analysis. 
Then, the Principal Components Analysis is conducted. The process adopts the Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. Six factors accumulated total interpretation quantity as 76.047% in Table7. The six factors are renamed to: (1). Apply a method to generate the ideas; (2).Analyse requirements to solve the problem; (3). Apply the knowledge to create new product; (4).Satisfy the demand and be active in innovation; (5). Topic-oriented and propose the innovation; (6). Client-oriented and be courageous in innovation.

Conclusions
The “innovation ability” is one of the important professional competencies required in IT industry. Therefore, this study adopts the “process perspective” of creativity to serve as its study approach. In the first stage, through literature review and focus group expert consultations, such eight indices as market sensitivity, organizational integration, complexity, originality, flexibility, novelty, fluency, and creative impulse, etc. of innovation ability are obtained. In accordance with the pre-test and post-test scales of the completion of development for each index, the instruction effect can be effectively verified.  
In the second stage, the Quasi-experimental research method is applied to engage in the instruction experiment of applying the Q-technique in cultivating the creativity instruction of “innovation ability”. The systematic learning from the generation of innovation to marketization is particularly concerned. The experimental result shows the instruction effect to be significant, verifying the Q-technique to be applicable to the innovative instruction in the information field; the Q-technique can cultivate the complexity and fluency in the indices of innovation ability, as next to it being market sensitivity, organizational integration, flexibility, and novelty; as to the originality and creative impulse, it fails to attain the level of significance. 
Concerning the factor attitude part of the third stage, the post-test scale analysis result shows the following are obtained: such six factors as the application method to generate ideas, analysis requirement in problem solving, application of knowledge in innovating a new product, satisfaction of requirements in active innovation, topic-oriented in proposing ideas, and customer-oriented in being brave to innovate, etc. The topics contained in each factor may serve as the reference basis for a further reform of innovative teaching. The research contribution lies in the manifestation of the Q-technique to be applicable to the instruction of innovation ability; it facilitates the change in students’ mental models, and promote their output in innovation. 
In the aspect of study limitation, the unit instruction experiment is merely 8 weeks, that its instruction effect can only confirm the clear contribution of the Q-technique toward the “process perspective” through the experimental verification of a longer term. In the aspect of the future studies, concerning the verification study of changing the mental models of students, the Q-technique can be extended to the application studies in other professional fields than the information field.
