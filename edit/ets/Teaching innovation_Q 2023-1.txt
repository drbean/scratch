Teaching for Enhancing Innovation Ability Using Q-technique

This study confirms the instructional effect of the Q-technique in enhancing the innovation ability of students. The focus group and quasi-experimental methods were applied. First of all, innovation ability was confirmed by experts to be a professional competency required by enterprises. Next, Q-technique unit instruction in the form of an experiment designed to increase students' innovation ability was performed. In the course of the experiment, it was realized that innovation ability is composed of eight components, and the Q-technique does upgrade students’ innovation ability. In application in practice, the Q-technique can result in integral learning in a systematic manner from TODO: the creativity till the innovative products in technology; to supplement the deficiency in innovation ability literatures of the “process perspective”. In the aspect of contribution, the Q-technique can be applied to innovative instructions and the changes of mental models, valuable to the reform of innovation teaching. 
Keywords: IT enterprise, professional competency, curriculum, Q-technique.

Introduction
How to reduce the difference between the innovation ability requirements of enterprises and the focus of innovation curricula is an important issue in employability (Støren & Aamodt, 2012). Through higher education, the difference between work requirements and the competencies of employees can be alleviated, reducing the frequency of a mismatch between job requirements and education results (Green et al, 2002). However, industry demand-oriented professional competencies must be an important basis for curriculum innovation. Therefore, through a continued innovation in curriculum, and successive focusing on professional competency requirements, the employability of students can be upgraded, and the education and service compliance of graduated students can be promoted (Li, Yen, & Cheng, 2008；Chang & Chang, 2011). 
It has been pointed out in previous studies that innovation ability is one of the important indices of information employability (Chang, 2014). It already forms one of the important competencies required by contemporary IT enterprises (Ehrenmann & Warschat, 2013). By so-called innovation, we mean creativity plus market application (Ettlie, 2000). In other words, to upgrade innovation, although it is still required to trace the source of the inspiration in creativity, the creative result must be further marketized, to facilitate ideas that generate market value.
Concerning the integration of the results of studies in the creativity literature, the approaches of several such studies can be summarized to be oriented toward the influence perspective, the structure perspective, the process perspective and consequentialism, etc. (Chang, 2013). The influence perspective above, as for example, in Piffer (2012) defines the relationship of creativity and products to be higher than the relationship of creativity to human beings. The structure perspective, for example, Gruys, Munshi, & Dewett (2011) think only with the novel and value generation can ideas or actions be considered to be provided with creativity. Studies following the process perspective concentrate on the application of brainstorming to generate ideas, procedures, actions or behaviors with creativity (Drazin, et al., 1999). Consequentialism points out that the result of creativity is closely related to marketability (Duke & Mount, 1996). As the outcome of creativity is highly related to market demand, this conforms to the true implications of creativity as far as the requirements of industry and education are concerned. At the same time it points out two major problems which are encountered in the creativity study approach of the process perspective. The first problem is that in the past, the “process perspective” has concerned itself with the production process of creativity (Drazin, et al., 1999; Gomes, Kruglianskas, & Scherer，2011), but without any special attention to the systematic learning generated in the process from creation to marketization. The second problem is that the transition in technology is rapid, yet the cultivation of innovation ability is in lack of a learning method with high operability that fits the learner’s technical life experience, and further inspires high performance increases in creativity by means of recognition, identification and change of mental models. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, it is necessary to find an effective learning method to aid the learner to attain a comprehensive learning ability that sustains him/her from the generation of ideas, through the results of innovation, to the end in the marketization process. 
In order to attain the cultivation of this “innovation ability”, the Q-technique is introduced in this study as the instruction method. The purpose of this study was to confirm the Q-technique's instructional effect in enhancing the students’ innovation ability. The major difference between this and other studies is that it particularly emphasizes recognition, identification and changes in mental models as key factors in technology product innovation. The contribution of the study is that the learning of the Q-technique method can improve the performance of students in the IT field in innovation. It verifies the Q-technique can be applied in innovative instruction, contributing reference value to the reform of innovation teaching.
Index in Innovation Ability
The requirement that the IT industry has of innovation ability, from the viewpoint of competency-based theory, is that its possessors be able to engage in innovative IT work that creates high added value (Chang & Chang, 2014). Under the guidance of this theory, creativity and expressed innovation have already become mandatory professional competencies of IT personnel (Baytiyeh, 2012). Concerning “innovation ability”, this study follows the approach of the process perspective, applying the definitions provided by Amabile (1983). That is: creativity is considered to be an interaction of an individual within an internal system, or the performance of an individual in interaction with the external environment. 
In order to explore innovation ability increases, confirmation of the priority of various factors in its composition shall be necessary (Chang, 2013). Ehrenmann and Warschat (2013) indicate that uncertainty, flexibility and adaptability are essential properties of innovation ability. Besemer & Treffinger (1981) conclude there are 14 indices on the basis of which to judge innovation, each separately classifiable into three categories: (1) novelty (originality, ingenuity, convertibility); (2) problem solving (adequacy, relevance, logicality, utility, and value); (3) elaboration and comprehensiveness (attractiveness, complexity, excellence, manifesting, system organization, tact). Chang (2014) points out the essential properties of innovation ability can be regarded to include eight items: (1) sensitivity to a problem, (2) organizational integration, (3) complexity, (4) originality, (5) flexibility (6) novelty (7) fluency and (8) creative impulse, among others. Piffer (2012) thinks creativity includes three dimensions, i.e., novelty, appropriateness and impact. Integrating the indices, definitions and topic distribution of innovation ability obtained from these studies, we arrive at the indices shown in the following Table 1.

Methodology
Focus Group method: Three separate focus group sessions were conducted. A total 24 experts in the industrial and academic fields were invited to participate in the joint discussion and study; among them 18 came from ICT as junior and senior managers, and 6 were scholars. The objective of the meetings mainly was to confirm that “innovation ability” is one of the professional competencies required by IT enterprises, and the rationality of each index. Next, the aim was to revise the pre-test and post-test scales; review the rationality of the design of the instructional activities; and check the feasibility of an instruction/learning mode, etc. 
Quasi-experiment
Design of the experiment: Taking the senior students of the IT Management Department of a University of Science and Technology in Taiwan as the target, purposive sampling was used to assign 44 students each to the experimental group and to the baseline group. The experimental group received the “Q-technique instruction mode” (i.e., X1), and the baseline group received the “general instruction mode” (i.e., C), in the traditional lecture manner as the main instruction type as shown in Table 2. The same teaching material was used, to engage in instruction for a total 8 weeks, with 2 hours each week. Each class was divided into 9 teams, with 4-5 people in each team. An assignment was done in a group manner, and was handed in in fulfillment of class requirements.

Remarks: X1 refers to involvement in the experiment; C refers to the control treatment; Y1 refers to the pre-test score; Y2 refers to the post-test score.

Development of the Pre-test Scale and Post-test Scale: Taking the content perspective of eight “innovation abilities” as its basis, a pre-test scale and post-test scale were prepared in accordance with the behavioural events method of Dessler (2007), to serve as evaluation tools in the instruction experiment. For each topic, the Likert Scale 5-point design (1=not important, 5=very important) was applied. The topic distribution of each index is shown in Table 3. 
Data Analysis: In the first stage, a covariance analysis was applied to engage in the verification of the effect of an experiment instruction. It is attempted to check if the difference between both the experimental group and baseline group reaches a significant level. As to the analysis, the pre-test scores before learning are taken as the covariance, under different instruction modes as independent variables; while the post-test scores after learning are taken as dependent variables, to inspect the instruction effect of the Q-technique unit instruction. In the second stage, a factor analysis shall be conducted in terms of the post-test results; the obtained Q factors represent a kind of hypothesis attitude (Lo, 1985). The objective is to base on the characteristic value to serve as a criterion to judge the strength/weakness of the attitude of each topic factor, in order to understand the level of promoting each index of innovation ability through the innovation ability instruction by means of the Q-technique, and interpret the mental mode changes of the learners. 

Implementation
Design of instruction activity
Taking the “Innovation Ability Application of the Q-technique” to be the instruction unit. The instruction shall be fulfilled in accordance with three procedures. That is (1) the cultivation of “innovation ability” shall serve as the instruction objective, (2) design a group assignment topic, and (3) implement the instruction (including pre-test and post-test). The instruction/learning objectives shall be shown as in the following Table 3.

Able to seek for answers in accordance with the technique and procedure of the Q-technique, demonstrate and report the results. 
In a supportive environment, able to perform a better market sensitivity and fluency, and flexible thinking ability. 

Q-technique Instruction Design
The Q-technique was a kind of method specializing in studying the subjectivity of human beings, able to be referred to as Q-method, Q-technique, Q-sort (Barbosa et al., 1998). It can be defined that a subject by means of his own pointed statement of opinion, for him to define the attitude as a kind in combination of qualitative and quantitative research method (Dennis & Goldberg, 1996). The goal of applying Q-technique is to, after completing the construction of Q population through brainstorming, select the Q sample through group discussions; and perform ordering concerning the statement sentences of the Q sample, to acquire the priority order of the innovation content items. The design of teacher/student activity had shown as Table 4.

Results & Discussion
The application of Q-technique with adequacy
The application of Q-technique to the instruction of innovation ability shall be provided with adequacy. Concerning the implementation of Q-technique, it integrates the application of brainstorming; similarly as the manner of KJ method in generating innovation (Kunifuji & Kato, 2007), sharing the same principle through different expressions. 
During the instruction process, it is required to through the activity practice attain the active learning and participating into the “doing” process of the students as a conscious recognition (Burton, Schlemer, & Vanasupa, 2012). Substantially speaking, the difference of Q-technique from the traditional instruction mainly deals with its catalyzing the ideas identification of students, and hence promoting the generation of innovation. Through the recognition of innovation and the upgrading of the thinking ability of an individual, it incurs a change in mental model. The application of Q-technique to the instruction of ingenuity conforms to the viewpoints of Drazin, et al., (1999); Gomes, Kruglianskas, and Scherer (2011) concerning the process perspective in creativity. 
In additions, the application of Q-technique to the instruction of innovation conforms to the instruction concept of the scientific creation thinking (Burton, Schlemer, & Vanasupa, 2012), also conforms to the group dynamics addressed by Cole and Faota (2005), and the systematic approach of the argument in mental model (Capelo & Dias, 2009). In other words, its emphasis deals with the mutual knowledge sharing in a group discussion; it helps to break through the personal thinking framework, change the thinking habit, and further promote the generation of creativity.
Instruction effect of the Q-technique
Concerning the reliability and validity test in a test scale, the Content Validity is conducted by experts for its draft, to check if the scale content sufficiently reflects the substantial essence. Concerning the reliability of the scale, the entire Cronbach α=0.958, while the Cronbach α of each topic ranges between 0.956~0.960, all attaining a high reliability. It shows there is a high accordance inside the topic respondents. Concerning the examination of homogeneity for the regression coefficient in a group, the results as F=.307, p=.581>.05, both showing failing to be significant, indicating the slopes of regression line of both groups to be the same, conforming to the homogeneity of the regression coefficient assumptions in the covariance group. The covariance analysis is conducted continuously. Concerning the results of the Tests of Between-Subjects Effects, F value =13.724; p=.000<.001. It shows after eliminating the influence of the pre-test performance record, the treatment effect of the experiment is significant. That is, the learning performance record of the experimental group after applying the instruction by means of Q-technique is obviously better than that of the baseline group.

Priority ordering of indices of innovation ability
The 17 items with distribution in the positive side are highly regarded, as shown in Fig. 1.  Concerning the distribution of items for the innovation ability content, it shows the instruction units of innovation ability, the priority order in the positive group from high to low are: +3 groups (d19、c14、f30), +2 groups (f31、c13、g36、d22、g35、b10), +1 group (e29, h42, b11, e24, g39, a1, a5, c12). After a further analysis is conducted for the attributed indices of innovation ability, three items each for complexity and fluency are acquired as the maximum, next to it are two items each concerning originality, novelty, market sensitivity, organizational integration, and flexibility, etc. Its result in general conforms to the originally set experimental instruction objective.

Q-technique in promoting innovation ability
The scales shall not serve for the analysis of the covariance of learning effect only; the data obtained from the post-test scale also through a factor analysis interprets the factor characteristics (Barbosa et al., 1998). Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (Approx. Chi-Square) = 1118.992, df =435, p<.01, confirming each perspective to be close to the normal multivariate; and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy, KMO=.801. Therefore, it is adequate to perform a factor analysis. 
Then, the Principal Components Analysis is conducted. The process adopts the Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. Six factors accumulated total interpretation quantity as 76.047% in Table7. The six factors are renamed to: (1). Apply a method to generate the ideas; (2).Analyse requirements to solve the problem; (3). Apply the knowledge to create new product; (4).Satisfy the demand and be active in innovation; (5). Topic-oriented and propose the innovation; (6). Client-oriented and be courageous in innovation.

Conclusions
The “innovation ability” is one of the important professional competencies required in IT industry. Therefore, this study adopts the “process perspective” of creativity to serve as its study approach. In the first stage, through literature review and focus group expert consultations, such eight indices as market sensitivity, organizational integration, complexity, originality, flexibility, novelty, fluency, and creative impulse, etc. of innovation ability are obtained. In accordance with the pre-test and post-test scales of the completion of development for each index, the instruction effect can be effectively verified.  
In the second stage, the Quasi-experimental research method is applied to engage in the instruction experiment of applying the Q-technique in cultivating the creativity instruction of “innovation ability”. The systematic learning from the generation of innovation to marketization is particularly concerned. The experimental result shows the instruction effect to be significant, verifying the Q-technique to be applicable to the innovative instruction in the information field; the Q-technique can cultivate the complexity and fluency in the indices of innovation ability, as next to it being market sensitivity, organizational integration, flexibility, and novelty; as to the originality and creative impulse, it fails to attain the level of significance. 
Concerning the factor attitude part of the third stage, the post-test scale analysis result shows the following are obtained: such six factors as the application method to generate ideas, analysis requirement in problem solving, application of knowledge in innovating a new product, satisfaction of requirements in active innovation, topic-oriented in proposing ideas, and customer-oriented in being brave to innovate, etc. The topics contained in each factor may serve as the reference basis for a further reform of innovative teaching. The research contribution lies in the manifestation of the Q-technique to be applicable to the instruction of innovation ability; it facilitates the change in students’ mental models, and promote their output in innovation. 
In the aspect of study limitation, the unit instruction experiment is merely 8 weeks, that its instruction effect can only confirm the clear contribution of the Q-technique toward the “process perspective” through the experimental verification of a longer term. In the aspect of the future studies, concerning the verification study of changing the mental models of students, the Q-technique can be extended to the application studies in other professional fields than the information field.
