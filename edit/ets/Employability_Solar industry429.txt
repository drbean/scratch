Constructing Employability Indicators for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Engineering Education for the Solar Industry


Abstract

The aim of this research is to establish a set of employability indicators that capture the future competency requirements and performance expectations that solar energy enterprises have of their engineers. The qualitative study conducted interviewing 12 administrators and 32 engineers from Solar enterprises, meetings with focus groups intended to formulate the questionnaire for quantitative survey to Taiwanese Solar enterprises for the confirmation and prioritization of employability indicators. The result built the interpretational model for competence, job performance, working attitude and employability for Solar corporation talents selection and cultivation as well as for school curricular development came into being. The interpretation model formulated can effectively interpret the relationship between Solar enterprises¡¦ expectations and students¡¦ employability. The research has contributed the qualification form for talents selection and the assessment form for talents cultivation, as well as valuable references for curricular development in engineering education. 
Keywords: Solar Industry, employability, competence, performance, indicator.
     
1. Introduction

The study of employability is a field of complex nature about which questions are often raised, questions for which there is at not at all times a clear and definitive answer [1]. As pointed out by many researchers, employability is closely related to the competence and performance possibilities demonstrated by individuals [2, 3, 4]. Its ultimate measure is the contribution to the performance of an enterprise by the employee where the said performance is the output, or production results, of the enterprise. When the employee commands the competence required by the enterprise then it can be expected that the employee will demonstrate the performance anticipated by the enterprise [25]. Such competence can be broken down into four types: core competence, professional competency, management competence, and general competence [6]. In addition, the common core competences needed by staff of all departments of an enterprise could include: customer orientation, teamwork cooperation, profession orientation, active aggressiveness, and performance orientation [4]. Obviously, the competence and performance requirements that enterprises bring to the attention of their employees has made employability an issue of concern for all solar enterprises and every employee. 

As pointed out in competence-based theory, the important features of solar industry employability are the emphasis on advancing competence by individuals, and in particular, a focus on the advancement of competence in long-term self career development embarked upon by engineers. Therefore, this research aims to answer the following questions: what job performance skills are graduates of universities of technology from solar energy-related departments required to demonstrate by employers and how should these skills be reflected in major student employability indicators? The major contribution of these indicators in the solar industry would be for the selection of talent in recruitment and as a reference for the internal cultivation of talent and for on-the-job training; while in engineering education, they would provide a basis for the planning and design of the solar energy curriculum, enhancing university students¡¦ employability [25]. 

Accordingly, the research focused on what is required for students who have been employed in the solar industry to sustain long term employment there, translating these job performance requirements of the workplace via qualitative research methods into employability indicators [30, 31], as well as confirming the applicability of the employability indicators through a qualitative survey and analysis [34]. Thus the purpose of the research was to establish a set of employability indicators for students contemplating employment in the solar industry after graduation from universities of technology. The aim was that the indicators would represent the performance that solar industry enterprises expected students to demonstrate in their future job positions in ways that made the demands of such jobs painfully obvious. From which starting point, the research desired to establish a competence and performance interpretation model for the selection of talent by enterprise recruiters and for reference by internal solar enterprise talent cultivation planners. With these goals, the role of and implications for curricular planning in engineering education take on ever clearer shape. The research¡¦s primary contribution to theory is the establishing of an interpretation model for the relationship between competence, job performance, working attitudes and employability, by means of the establishment of employability indicators in the solar industry. 

2.Employability

Employability is generally recognised as the ability of a student to successfully apply for employment after graduation in a smooth way, to maintain their long term prospects for similarly acquired positions, and to develop their job careers favourably over the remainder of their working lives [7]. Cox and King [8] consider employability to signify a person¡¦s possession of the ability to acquire skills for the implementation of required jobs, indicating employability does not necessarily mean a person could start working immediately without further training. Employability can be deemed to be a special feature of a person¡¦s capability for work and the desire to maintain his or her attractiveness in the labour market [9]. Hillage and Pollard [10] assume ¡§employability¡¨ to mean the individual could self-sufficiently realise his or her potential for employment in the labour market, and continue to demonstrate self-sufficiency in his or her work position even when there are limited job resources. Pool & Sewell [11] believe that employability could be understood as its embodiment in an individual who possesses a set of skills, knowledge and ability to develop satisfactorily and successfully in the employment market. Rothwell and Arnold [2] deem from the point of view of an individual¡¦s employment and career development, that employability is concerned with long term career development in professional fields, even to the point of inclusion of the capability to shift into different professions [12]. In this view, the essence of employability can even be seen as the capability of an individual to shift into another profession for employment after the employment market of the individual¡¦s professional field is saturated. Hence, employability also emphasises the possession of a good profession spillover effect. Accordingly, this paper defines employability in the domain of the solar industry as the embodiment in an individual of the capability to maintain the ongoing acquisition of knowledge, skills and positive attitudes, and to properly translate learning experiences into such forms, so as to maintain demonstrations of the performances expected by enterprises on being employed. Persons with high employability potential can learn fast when they are asked to execute a task demanded by a job, and they can transform personal knowledge and skills into the expected job performance according to the job scenario¡¦s requirements of the solar industry.

Diverse point of view of employability 


Three different aspects, input, process and result, afford different views on employability, contributing to the direction of research: 


The input point of view, which sets out from the point of view of structuralism to explore the composition of employability, based on competence-based theory, considers that an individual must possess good competence to be able to demonstrate high performance on the job. Such researchers as Hafeez & Essmail [13], Peng [14], and Rae [1] demonstrate this point of view.


Research results based on competence-based performance theory are emerging [15]. Robbins [16] assumes performance measurement based on competence could include individual job output, behaviour, personal characteristics (including the exhibition of attitudes, self-confidence, independence, cooperation, experience, etc. related to superb job performance). Competence-based theory has done well explaining the reference criteria adopted by modern enterprises for recruitment, so graduates need to possess the competences required by the employment market. 


The process point of view, which emphasises a high level of association between school curricula and the employment market. considers it is necessary to reflect enterprise experts' expectations of students in curricular design and learning activities. School subjects should maintain focus on the changes in practical needs [17]. Rae [1] believes that the students¡¦ experience of learning core subjects should be associated with enterprises and employability. 


The result point of view, which takes the point of view of behaviourism and follows resource-based theory exploring the demonstration of employability, translates performance standards required by the working world into the job performances expected by enterprises, by for example the empirical investigation of resource-driven performance conducted by Fernandes, Mills, and Fleury [18].


Resource-based theory considers the three elements, company-critical resources, capabilities and competencies to be associated concepts [19], where capabilities and competencies are considered to be interchangeable [20]. The term, capabilities was considered by the Ljungquist [21] study to have two meanings, one was the ability of a work team to utilise resources needed in execution of a certain task or activity; the other was an individual¡¦s tacit knowledge and organizational memory, which could be incorporated and applied to job coordination. As pointed out in resource-based theory, enterprises expect graduates who are devoted to the workplace to demonstrate good ability in integrative planning and the disposal of available resources. Therefore this research took its direction from the result point of view on employability and emphasised job performance standards to be decided according to the enterprise workplace¡¦s surroundings, coupled with experts¡¦ judgment, developing the requirements for students¡¦ employability in solar enterprises. 


Employability indicators 

Employability indicators from the performance point of view naturally put emphasis on job performance. So-called job performance can be defined as the pursuance of special action by a person with the ability to maintain and conform to the condition, policy and procedure given by the organizational environment to effectively accomplish the job demands [22]. ¡§Job¡¨ is considered to be a certain special appointment in the achievement of a certain task, while the task is a description of the activity content of a certain job for an employee [23]. The performance of an employee can include the two categories of job behaviour and activity, and job result [24]. The former applies to the job process itself, and is assessed mainly by measuring the activity engaged in and the behaviour demonstrated on the job by the employee; while the latter assesses the degree of accomplishment by the employee of a predetermined target. As pointed out by SPSP[28], job performance needs to emphasise ACT, which means:
     A: employees' effective and timely completion of a job Activity;
     C: employees' Competence to do a good job;
     T: their possession of Tools and Techniques.
     In aspect of employability indicators, Table 1 summarises related studies.

NTNU[5]ƒç A 2005 follow-up survey of university graduates after one year of employment found insufficiencies in employability and concluded the causes to be lack of leadership capacity, innovation capacity, the capacity to apply theory to actual work, professional certificates or related capacities, knowledge of the relevant industrial environment and its development status, foreign language capacity, full understanding and planning for self-career development, possession of job searching and self-promoting capacity.

Jaffer, Ng¡¦ambi & Czerniewicz [38]ƒç Efficiency and quality are the challenges of industry for advanced education. 

Chang & Kuo [26]ƒçFour common dynamic capabilities in response to external demands: ¡§market-oriented sensitivity¡¨, ¡§the ability to absorb knowledge¡¨, ¡§social-networking capability¡¨ and ¡§the integrative ability to communicate and negotiate¡¨. 3 special dynamic capabilities required by business practices: ¡§the capability to identify what drives market growth¡¨, ¡§the capability to develop a good sense of market-entry timing¡¨ and ¡§the capability to alter/create customers¡¦ needs¡¨.

Chang [27]ƒçMarket-oriented sensitivity, the ability to absorb knowledge, social-networking capability, and the integrative ability to communicate and negotiate are the dynamic capabilities required of IT entrepreneurs.      
  
In summary of the above, the logical process for the establishment of draft employability indicators in this research following the performance point of view is:
     (1). To define the performance point of view of employability;
     (2). To obtain ¡§diverse points of view on employability¡¨;
     (3). To fold in the path of research from the ¡§resulting point of view¡¨.

For (1), we took the point of view of Ljungquist [21], SPSP [28], Chang [27, 25], and Kuo et al. [39] and decided performance-point-of-view employability to be on-the-job integrated planning, evaluation and judgment, working efficiency, working quality, working spirit, monitoring control, and working attitude. 

Based on the needs of the research, the operational definitions for each indicator are as shown in Table 2.

3. Methodology

The study adopted field interviews and meetings with focus groups as its qualitative methods; while a questionnaire survey provided data for its quantitative methods. 

Field interviews: The field interviews were conducted with 12 administrators (see Table 3) from solar enterprises throughout Taiwan and with 32 of the top-10%, high-performing workers. All interviews were completed within a 5-month period. The interview form used in this study followed Dessler¡¦s methods [40] for the collection of duties for graduates¡¦ first employment in solar enterprises, where the STAR specific behavioural events included: (1) Situation: the circumstance surrounding an incident; (2) Task: the target generated in response to the demands of the situation; (3) Action: the behaviour exhibited by the person in charge; (4) Result: the outcome of the action. The Behavioural Event Interview (BEI) method was applied in translating the behavioural events into the questionnaire items.

Key points in the STAR-specific behavioural event interview included the listing of each STAR item with emphasis on the response a good performance worker should exhibit for each supposed demonstrative behavioural feature, the degree of improvement through training, the possibility to make up a performance insufficiency via recruiting new employees, the capacity standard (certificate requirement) needed by individuals, and the suggestion for measures when the individual¡¦s competence is inadequate to demonstrate the anticipated performance(see Table 4, 5).

Focus group method: A group was formed of 12 experts, amongst whom was a manpower resources consultant and specialists from industry and academia. Focus group meetings were held with the participation of the consultant, general manager, marketing plan manager, manpower resources department staff representatives, department heads, managers, scholars, and high-performing workers. In the process of the group's repeated discussion, the draft questionnaire that originally contained 110 questions was modified and combined to formulate the final questionnaire with 37 questions. The structure of the questionnaire is shown in the following table:
     

Table 6 (Mr. Greg, please do in WORD for this part, tks!)


No changes in table



Survey research: Through analysis by the experts of the focus group, the draft questionnaire was tested for its reliability and overall validity. Cronbach¡¦s £\ coefficient was used to examine the internal consistency of responses from pre-test receivers. The content validity of the test was assessed through the confirmation of the employability indicators by the focus group and systematic examination of the questionnaire content to determine whether the questionnaire did fully reflect the practical behaviours represented by the employability indicators. Afterwards, Bartlett¡¦s sphericity test was applied to confirm whether each aspect was near normal multivariate; and the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) measure of sampling adequacy was adopted for the factor validity test to determine whether factor analysis was appropriate or not. Finally, the major step of content analysis was performed, conducting oblique rotation for maximum variance of the factors revealed by the factor analysis with the intent of assessing the validity of the construction of the questionnaire and the order of importance of the employability indicators. 
   
The methods for data collection adopted random sampling of small and medium Solar enterprises in Taiwan area for survey by the internet version of questionnaire. After subtracting repeated mails from the questionnaire returned, a total of 501 valid returns were received representing a valid return rate of 50.1%. The purpose of analyzing the data was to understand whether the employability indicators established by this research could receive popular recognition from Solar enterprises.
   
The application of the above mentioned research methods followed the logical procedures listed below, so as to receive research results at different stages.
„P Literature analysis: to obtain key points for field interviews;
„P Focus group meeting I: to confirm key points for field interviews via experts¡¦ point of view;
„P Behavioural Events interview method: to obtain the draft employability indicators from performance point of view;
„P Focus group meeting II: to confirm the draft employability indicators and the draft questionnaire;
„P Implementation of survey and data analysis.

Among them, several meetings were held during Stage II of the focus group meeting due to diverging opinions from experts on the significance of employability indicators. It was considered that a high degree of differences existed in the direct performance indicators between Solar enterprises for manufacturing and services that it was not appropriate to directly translate the direct performance requirements for employees into the requirements for students¡¦ employability. Therefore, the direct performance requirements for field interviews were transformed to become indirect requirements so that they could represent enterprises¡¦ expectation for performance as translated into employability. 

4. Results and discussions

Working attitude, competence, job performance and employability form an interactional model

The research is based on competence-based theory to explore performance standards to be demonstrated through field interviews with Solar enterprises in order to formulate seven employability indicators including: working attitude, working efficiency, integrated planning, working spirit, evaluation and judgement, monitoring control, and working quality. A triangle shaped interpretation model can be used to summarise through the research results. This triangle model is jointly constructed by competence, job performance, and working attitude, where the degree of dependence between competence and job performance forms the degree of expectation value for students¡¦ employability from enterprises. The concept is shown in Fig. 1. From the results of field interviews, it can be seen that ¡§working attitude¡¨ is the basis for an employee to fully express his or her competence and demonstrate the ¡§job performance¡¨ expected by the Solar enterprise. Employability shall not only demonstrate consistency between the level of an individual¡¦s ¡§competence¡¨ and ¡§job performance¡¨ but also the expected high employability so as to create the individual¡¦s employable value for long term employment. The significance contains the followings (as in Fig. 2):
„P Working attitude and competence, job performance together form an interactional model. The level of the employability expectation value signifies the employability for long term employment in Solar enterprise.
„P The variation in employability expectation value is based on working attitude; where working attitude determines the level demonstrated in competence and job performance in Solar enterprise.
„P There is dependence between competence and job performance; where students who possess the competence can demonstrate the expected job performance in Solar enterprise.
„P Being affected by the enterprises¡¦ internal organizational behaviour, employees with high competence might not necessarily demonstrate high job performance. However, the possession of high working attitude may improve such condition.
„P Working attitude determines the level of competence and job performance. The possession of aggressive working attitude and active learning competence can help increasing job performance. When an individual¡¦s job performance is not as expected, good working attitude could enable the individual to pursue even higher job performance and to improve the individual¡¦s value for long term employment in Solar enterprise.

A part of the competence was augmented and the performance requirement was diminished
   From cross-comparison of field interview records it was shown that even the interviewed objectives were screened in advance however the interview results still exhibited a part of the work items to have been exaggerated for the competence required. Conversely, it also exhibited a part of the enterprises¡¦ expected job performance was weakened. Possible reasons for this may include:
„P Enterprises are generally likely to consider students who are the first to be employed as the ones who are more likely to execute their job task under the assistance from senior supervisors. 
„P Enterprises usually consider students¡¦ possession of professional certificates as merely having the minimum level needed to enter the workplace, where on-the-job trainings (OJT) are still needed to a certain degree for students to qualify for the job properly.
„P The phenomenon that a part of the competence was seen as exaggerated, if not truly augmented, could be explained from the point of view of the expectation theory¡¦s angle of Chang [25], the interviewed persons might expect their opinions to be respected by their administrators to affect the company¡¦s salary adjustment policy.

The questionnaire had good reliability and validity
   In qualitative study, the overall questionnaire reached the Cronbach's ƒÑ value of 0.927, indicating the reliability to reach excellent level. The KMO reached 0.838 where the validity of all factors reached medium (KMO>0.7) level, indicating the stable effect of the questionnaire. Meanwhile, the Bartlett¡¦s value of 869.15(p<0.01) also indicated each aspect to be near normal multivariate and suitable for further factor analysis.
   The principal component analysis was adopted for factor analysis, and Promax with Kaiser Normalization was conducted. The employability index chose Eigen value >0.7, factor loading >0.6, and the standard for extracted factor was assessed as one that should contain at least two items for assessment. The reason for the selecting of Eigen value>0.7 was to ensure the goodness-of-fit for the factor model to reach certain level and the adoption of Kaiser method and Scree test as solution was feasible. Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the factors, Scree test was conducted for the discretion of the number of factor. The analysis results extracted 18 items and 7 factors with the interpretation capability reaching 80.35% as listed in the following Table 7.  


Table 7 (Mr. Greg, please do in WORD for this part, tks!)
  

The purpose of factor analysis was to obtain the construct validity of the questionnaire, and to form the basis for judging the order of importance of the employability indicators. The application of factor analysis could extract common factors between the variables so as to make sure a less complicated data structure would ensue in the end. Through the findings for common factors, the content for conceptual structure can be said to be confirmed. The analysis results showed the questionnaire itself to be of good validity, while each employability indicator was based on the scale of Eigen value, where the order of importance was ranked from high to low as: Integrated Planning, Working Spirit, Monitoring Control, Working Attitude, Evaluation & Judgment, Working Efficiency, Working Quality. 


Description of statistical analysis

The valid returns consisted of sampling from 338 males (67.5%) being the highest, and 163 females, while the sampling age was distributed as 26-30 (57.5%), 21-25 (21/25%), 31-35 (16.25%). Technical duty was the highest (71.8%) among the duties surveyed, as listed in Table 8; where the seniority from 3 years to less than 5 years (41.0%) occupied the most, as listed in Table 9. Averages and standard deviations for different categories are shown in the following Table 10. 


Table 8  (Mr. Greg, please do in WORD for this part, tks!)
 
Table 9  (Mr. Greg, please do in WORD for this part, tks!)

Table 10  (Mr. Greg, please do in WORD for this part, tks!)



Observation of the distribution of each employability indicator from ¡§individual average¡¨ shows the three items: working spirit, evaluation & judgment, working quality to be significantly higher. The possible phenomenon could come from the test samples which had the most from ¡§technical duty¡¨, therefore these three items were particularly emphasised. 


The radar chart indicates the strength of employability required by enterprises for students of Solar technology 

The purpose of the radar chart is to understand whether the questionnaire survey results indicate enterprises to expect university students¡¦ employability to reach the score of 60 as a generally acceptable level. Therefore, the strength of employability indicators expected by Solar enterprises was envisaged according to the average for each indicator to form the radar chart as shown in Fig. 3. Assuming the weighted value for each factor is the same, and taking the 5 level of classification from the questionnaire to have 5 as the highest and 1 as the lowest, then a triangle can be formed between any two factors. Accordingly, the ratio method was applied to calculation the area of included angle between the two factors (£G) by the equation £G=ab sin£c, where, a, b respectively represents the arm length (for example for £G1 area calculation where a=3.26, b=3.84)[7]. Hence, the strength of employability indicator is £U£G=92.20 in comparison to the ideal value £U£G=150 (i.e. the two arms a=5, b=5), and the strength can reach the ideal value of 61.47% after being true valued. It indicated the individual enterprise worker who accepted the survey considered the score of about 60 to be at an acceptable level for the requirement of employability to be demonstrated by students of Solar technology.

¡@¡@
Through the indication by radar chart analysis for each employability indicator, the averages obtained from the survey on the Likert scale were all over the level of 3 (such as 3.26 for Integrated Planning). However, from conversions of the radar chart areas, the returned Solar enterprises did not hold very high level of expectation for students¡¦ performance. It implied that enterprises required students¡¦ employability for only the minimum level but emphasised on the formation of the employees¡¦ competence and working attitude after their entry into the workforce. 

5. Conclusions 

The process in this research to obtain the seven employability indicators shared the concept of key performance indicators (KPI) and inferred their application to the expectation of employability for students of universities of technology. Therefore, the research process is essentially competence-based and as such is meant to achieve the desired effect of estimating competence from performance. The interpretation model formulated by competence, job performance, working attitude and employability can effectively interpret the relationship between enterprises¡¦ expectation and students¡¦ employability. In addition, since the acquisition of employability indicators came from the results of field interviews, it signified the path of this research that ventured out in its attempt to obtain the employability indicators in correspondence with the short life cycle of Taiwanese Solar industry¡¦s products and the special requirement for high market competition. Whereas, each indicator is also appropriate as the basis for reference to curricular planning in Solar related departments of universities in Taiwan area. In other words, when students possess the employability items named in this research then they shall hopefully be more encouraged to boldly conform to the ever stricter requirements for long term employment in enterprises. 

The application in practice, Solar enterprises can use the employability indicators to develop the ¡§Employability Assessment Form¡¨ that meets the requirement by individual enterprise for recruiting new employees as objectively as possible when needed. The employability indicators can be further applied to the planning for enterprise internal education training courses to enhance workers¡¦ employability for long term employment. 

Performance assessment can be quite difficult for Solar industry, which is categorised into Solar product manufacturing, Solar service, or technical service businesses where the knowledge and techniques for each category can largely vary in depth and broadness, therefore each company may expect students to perform differently. Based on limitation on the research, the study only explored the ¡§job performance¡¨ in direct relationship with work. The study suggests future development of this subject as follows:

Curricular design based on the employability indicators. The seven items of employability indicators obtained from this research can be matched to job positions in Solar industry applicable to graduates with the planning of graduates¡¦ curriculum enhancement in mind as well as the employability in the field of Solar management at universities. The curriculum could include both the formal curriculum and informal curriculum section as well. The formal curriculum should have definitive goal structure, such as: employment targeted curriculum, practical training in Solar enterprises, industry and academia associated optional courses; while its informal counterpart can be based on industrial and academic activities, such as topical lectures, field visits to enterprises, workplace experiencing. The curriculum should be reviewed periodically by experts invited directly from industry in order to ensure the design of the curriculum corresponds to the requirement for employability indicators.
