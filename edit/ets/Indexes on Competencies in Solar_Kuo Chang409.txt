Abstract 
This study aims to develop professional competency indices and their interpretations as needed by the solar energy industry, to establish a basis for development of the engineering education curriculum. The methodologies adopted by the study are literature analysis, expert advisories, and focus groups. The study focuses on the establishment of competency indices by experts at stock market-listed companies, and then confirms these competencies with focus groups. The study found that the competencies required by the solar industry consist of knowledge, skills and understanding in the areas of materials development and applications, photovoltaic technology, cell manufacturing technology, biotechnology, chemical technology, power generation and electricity, process development and improvement, data collection and analysis, industry regulation, green energy beliefs, working attitudes and values. The results of this study can be used as the basis for the cultivation, selection, and employment of industry professionals.

Keywords: Index, Solar, Professional competency, and Engineering education.

1. Introduction
Green energy is an important industrial sector in an era of international competition. This energy sector includes: (1) the main industries of solar photovoltaic and LED lighting; and (2) the general potential industries of wind power, biofuels, hydrogen and fuel cells, energy information and communication, and electric vehicles among others [1]. The solar energy industry is one of the most important "Green Energy" industries. The output value of Taiwan's solar industry as a whole is expected to exceed 15 billion NTD in 2015, with the silicon solar cell module accounting for much of it, and ranking No. 4 in the world [1]. The maintenance of international competitiveness and sustainable development in the industry in the future will mainly depend on the quality of the industry's human resources. How to provide the professional competencies needed by the industry, and to further develop curricula to nurture talent are the core priorities of engineering education.
Research into the solar industry in the past has focused primarily on several different but related areas, including: business strategy, scientific knowledge and technology, tools and software applications, processes, and optimisation development. For example, in the area of business strategy, Chang and Guo [2] studied two sets of dynamic business competencies needed in the industry; in the technical area, there was a study of Guo et al. [3]. In professional competencies and solar energy competency standards and applications, O'net [4] established 51 industrial competency standards. Although there are not many studies focusing on how to teach energy technologies in engineering education, there is still energy education research related to ecology by Acikgoz [5] and the literature of solar energy education investigated by Dalitz, Toner, and Turpin [6]. In summary, solar industry engineer training studies mainly take competence-based and resource-based perspectives. Competence-based approaches can help build the core competencies of solar business professionals, so that enterprises can develop their core competencies with market segmentation. In terms of business strategy, resource-based approaches regard the professional talents of solar industry engineers as one of an enterprise's core resources, on the basis of which maximum benefit may be generated from the competitive market for the organisation, through the domination and appropriate allocation of resources.  In recent years, the solar industry has had to adapt to an ultra-competitive environment. An enterprise’s competitive advantage derived from resource strength is quickly eroded as a result of its competitors’ technological innovations [7, 30]. Moreover, the operations of international companies in the solar industry generally focus on the vertical integration of the supply chain, while Taiwan’s manufacturers mostly focus on specialised manufacturing [8, 29]. In view of the rapid changes in the technical content of a business's technologies, and since Taiwan’s advantages are in manufacturing, one of the biggest problems of engineering education is how to keep up with the changes in the professional competencies required by the industry and how to plan and design the curricula needed to foster the talent required for industrial development. Therefore, to establish a basis for the solution of this problem, this study aims to establish professional competency indices and their interpretation for the solar energy industry. The research may contribute, firstly, as a basis for the planning and designing of the curriculum for the training of engineers in higher education; and secondly, in the industrial sector, as an important reference for enterprises needing to select, train and utilise their human resources or to cultivate management's successors.
2. Theoretical background
Solar industry requires highly professional talents. The competence-based and resource-based theories have been regarded as two important theories in supporting the talent’s professional competency development for the solar industry. Workers with appropriate competencies needed to perform the tasks is extremely important [9, 10]. "Competency" can be regarded as: a prerequisite for a particular occupation, a set of performance standards, as well as the ability to complete the work/task [11]. According to the competence-based theory, the I-O psychologists generally considered that the competency model formed by KSAOs (Knowledge, Skill, Ability, Others) can be used to describe the critical capabilities required for performing a particular job [12]. Therefore, "Competency" can be regard as a set of capabilities that you should have when engaging in a particular task [13]. And this competency can be further subdivided into the general competency, the management competency, the professional competency, and the core competency [14]. Wherein, in terms of the professional competency expected by employer, the techniques and skills can predict the job performance of technical personnel [15, 16].
The resource-based viewers regard the professional talent as a rare, unique, and irreplaceable intangible asset for solar industry, who can create the competitive advantage for enterprise [17]. In other words, the resource-based viewers consider the unique resources within the enterprise as the fundamental source of competitive advantage of solar enterprise, while the talent is the core of this unique resource [2]. When the talent possesses the professional competencies required for performing the job, he owns the resources value desired by enterprise, so that the talent can get hired in the labour market. Therefore, according to the view of Sandberg and Pinnington [11], this study defines the professional competencies as a set of capabilities possessed by the university graduates to successfully perform the task when engaged in a professional mission in the field of solar energy.
3. Dimensions of professional competency
In the study results of solar executives, Chang and Guo [2] pointed out that the solar executives should have the commonality of dynamic competencies listed as the follows: the environmental sensing competencies, the learning absorption competency, the social networking competencies, as well as the coordination and integration competencies. Moreover, the required particular dynamic competencies are: the competency to discern the market's growth momentum, the competency to master the market timing, the competency to change or create customer’s demand. On the other hand, from the route of structuralism, in the dimensions of professional competency indices, the engineering education certification standards of ABET [18] listed the important core competencies such as the problem solving, the innovation, and the information competency. Abdullah et al. [19] explored the competency gaps by adopting the soft and hard skills. Wherein, the soft skills include ICT skills, personal qualities, thinking skills, interpersonal skills, management skills, and communication skills. Cilliers [20] regarded that these soft skills should also include "ability to produce reports", while the hard skills should include "practical usage of the software tools", "circuits construction", "operate, troubleshoots systems and equipment", "process, control and installation", "quality and reliability testing", etc. For example, in "Solar Energy Systems Engineers", O'net [4] listed the titles of this job, ten major tasks of engagement required by this job connotation, as well as the demanded data of each competency application including tools & technology, interests, work values, wages & employment trends, etc.
In summary, based on the 51 competency standards in O'net [4], the literatures of Cilliers [20], Kuo and Sheen [26], Abdullah et al. [19] and others, this study summarised 11 professional competencies and their connotation draft as the follows: materials development and application competency, photovoltaic technology competency, cell manufacturing technology competency, biotechnology competency, chemical technology competency, power generation and power competency, process development and improvement competency, data collection and analysis competency, regulation, green energy beliefs, work attitudes and values, etc.
4. Methodology
4.1. Literature analysis: the aim is through literature analysis to obtain the professional competency dimensions and connotation draft that should be possessed by the solar company grassroots engineers, as the bases for expert advisory and focus expert group discussion.
4.2. Expert advisory: From the enterprises employing point of view, the aims of expert advisory are to establish the professional competency dimensions for solar industry and to obtain the professional competencies demanded by the grassroots engineers. Wherein, the sample selection representatives are ten Taiwan’s solar companies listed in stock market, including the solar raw materials industry (two in upstream end), the solar manufacturing industry (five in midstream end) and the solar module and integration industry (three in downstream end), wherein the subjects interviewed in the field are the heads in middle and high levels.
4.3. Focus group method: The aim is to amend the connotation draft of each competency developed from the dimension of professional competency. The expert composition is shown in Table 1. In terms of sampling, the total of existing Taiwan’s solar manufacturers is 122, including the solar raw materials industry in the upstream end (e.g., pure metals, iron alloys and titanium metal, etc. and other metal materials, silicon chip production); the solar manufacturing industry in the midstream end (e.g., amorphous silicon thin film solar cells and modules; mono-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon solar cells and modules; silicon solar cells and modules; poly-silicon solar cells and modules; silicon, thin film solar cells), and the solar module and integration industry in the downstream end (e.g., small-scale solar power systems, solar electric power converter and solar power system). In three focus group meetings, the industrial and academic experts were jointly invited to discuss. Wherein, the invited industrial experts were from the manufacturers respectively with a scale of more than 30 employees, totalling 45 experts are the grassroots heads. In the academia, nine scholars within this study field were invited to participate in the discussion.

5. Results & discussion
This study found that the solar industry professional competency dimension is composed of 11 professional competencies. Wherein, each professional competency is further composed of several competency connotations, as shown in Table 2. On the application of research methods, in response to the needs in setting the professional competencies for the solar industry, DACUM (Develop A Curriculum) method is usually used, in which the experts use brainstorm technique to obtain the needed professional skill directory/listing [21]. In Delphi method, the expert anonymous manner is used to seek the advisory consistency between the professional competency and the connotation [22]. In V-tech method, the enterprise survey emphasises a large sample within the same industry to get a list of general professional competency needed for the engagement in a specific professional career [23]. This study adopted the expert advisory method, emphasising the qualitative expert interviews through the close contact with benchmark solar companies listed in stock market; together with the focus group method, after the discussions with the solar industrial experts, the professional competencies and their connotations for the solar industry are thus confirmed. Therefore, the research method adopted by this study can be regarded as an application of DACUM method essentially.
In terms of competency connotation, the professional engineers demanded in solar market, not only necessarily possess the technical knowledge and hard skills, but also need the soft skills, in order to foster the talent in line with market competition demand [24, 27]. Each competency dimension and connotation obtained by this study is composed of three fields, namely, knowledge, skill and attitude. Moreover, all the important soft skills are also fully covered in this study. Both the mental model and system concept are adopted by this study [25], in line with the requirement to foster professionals.

6. Conclusions
Although the international competition of the green energy industry is fierce, under the demand of human technology application to achieve the global ecological sustainability, the green energy industry is still subjected to universal attention. Since talent is the force to drive the industrial development, this study selected the solar industry talent cultivation as the topic of research. This study is grounded in the competence-based and resource-based theories, regarding the solar energy professionals as the important human resources of enterprises; and regarding the talent should possess various basic competencies needed to perform the job duties. Therefore, this study selected the benchmarking enterprises that are listed companies in the stock market from the upstream, midstream and downstream of Taiwan’s solar industry as the expert advisory to get the professional competency dimensions, coupled with the focus group meetings, to build the professional competency connotations for the solar industry. In summary, this study found 11 professional competencies and their connotations, which are the professional competencies should be required by the university graduates as a grassroots professional engineer.
On the practical application, the results of this study can be used as a talent selection standard for the enterprises in the field of solar energy for the further development or as the professional level assessment standard for talent promotion. On aspects of university application, the results of this study can be also used as the bases of talent cultivation, when planning and designing the curriculums. In the future, the implementation of these curriculums can nurture the appropriate talents demanded by the solar industry and create the benefits of shortening the gaps between school and industry. Therefore, this study specially demonstrates the contributions on the engineering education associated with the solar industry’s talent training curriculum, as well as on the application of enterprise’s talent selection and employment.
In terms of research restrictions, this study only focuses on the professionals’ competencies of commonality demanded by the solar enterprises, and does not focus on the study of professional competencies required by the specific enterprise in the upstream, midstream or downstream. This study also did not explore the connotation of a single solar expertise, including process design, software and hardware technologies, tools applications, etc. The interested researchers can do the further studies.
