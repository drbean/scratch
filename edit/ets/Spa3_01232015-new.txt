A Relational Perspective of Value Perception: Evidence from the Taiwanese Leisure Industry


Abstract
¡@Taking a relational perspective on the value perception relationship, we examine the mediation of value perception linking antecedents (viz., perceived quality, perceived price and perceived risk) and their consequence (viz., willingness to buy). A structural regression model of the structural equation modeling (SEM) type was constructed for our conceptual model to test the mediation. The findings imply that the immediate situational factors of perceived quality and perceived price contribute to perceived net value, which in turn partially leads to willingness to buy. Oppositely, the longer-term factor of perceived risk does not have both direct and indirect effects on perceived net value and willingness to buy, when making the infrequent decision to pay for a higher-priced leisure service. The findings provide managers directions for sales promotion in the spa hotel industry, suggesting they focus on increasing customer value by improving customer perceptions of overall quality with the setting of standards, and by providing customers preferential treatment in price.

Introduction
¡@The previous literature indicates that the creation of outstanding consumer value is instrumental to achieving sustainable financial and market success (Bolton & Drew, 1991; Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1998; Parasuraman, Berry, & Zeithaml, 1991; Swoboda, Pennemann, & Taube, 2012; Zeithaml, Berry, & Parasuraman, 1996), and a priority for all managers in the increasingly intense competition of the customer-centered market today (Bolton & Drew, 1991; Hu, Kandampully, & Juwaheer, 2009; McDougall & Levesques, 2000; M?ller, Rajala, & Westerlund, 2008; Ravald & Gronroos, 1996; Zeithaml, 1988) . 
¡@In a previous explorative study, we adopted economical deduction methods to demonstrate the adequate rationality of and construct positioning in our conceptual model, and correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between the constructs. The findings of our previous study had implications for understanding how consideration sets of service-related consumption are formed and how the recent downsizing economy has made attitudes to leisure service consumption more conservative because of a weakly significant relationship between perceived net value and willingness-to-buy. In a consequent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) study, we examined the framework linking antecedents of perceived net value and willingness-to-buy in the Taiwanese spa hotel industry, and six hypotheses were developed to identify the main effects. The hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) analysis revealed that the source of multi-collinearity among the antecedents resulted in a varied priority in regard to perceived net value, which was in turn positively associated with willingness to buy. The results also confirmed the dual effect of perceived price on perceived net value and perceived quality in the service domain. In addition, taking all the antecedents of perceived net value together into consideration, the results also demonstrated that the perception of perceived net value was mainly dependent upon quality, less dependent upon price, and least likely to depend upon risk in the service domain because of the multi-collinearity among the antecedents of perceived net value. 
¡@In the past decade companies and researchers have become aware of the great benefits of creating value for customers with respect to how customers may differ in their perceptions of value and, at the same time, of the need to determine the variables that explain such differences (Ruiz, Castro, & Armario, 2007). In spite of the documented relationships and the findings of our previous studies, the mechanisms underlying these relationships still remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study, our aim was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to probe the mechanisms of consumers¡¦ decision-making in leisure settings. A structural regression model was constructed to test three types of mediation: (1)the  mediator of perceived net value linking the antecedents, perceived quality, perceived price and perceived risk and the consequence, willingness to buy, (2) the mediator of perceived quality linking the antecedent, perceived price and its consequence, perceived net value, and (3) the mediator of perceived risk linking the antecedent, perceived quality and its consequence, perceived net value.

Literature review

Consumer perception
¡@The antecedents to perceived net value studied in the last two decades of the 20th century have been mainly limited to the two traditional basic functions of product perceived quality and perceived monetary price. Thus, Zeithaml (1988) described value in terms of a tradeoff of salient ¡§give¡¨ and ¡§get¡¨ components. At the same time, Peter and Tarpey (1975) identified three broad, strategy-based consumer decision-making frameworks. The first is a perceived risk framework that characterizes the consumer as motivated to minimize the expected negative consequences, or utility, of a purchase. The second is an attitude framework that is oriented to positive evaluations. The third is a valence framework that assumes the consumers perceive a product as having both positive and negative attributes. Consumers act to maximize the overall or ¡§net¡¨ valence resulting from negative and positive attributes of an act. The so-called net valence of this additive utility model is the arithmetic difference between the positive valences and the negative valences. Such additive utility models can be described as cognitive or rational models of decision making. Meanwhile, Spreng, Dixon, and Olshavsky (1993) conceptualized expected or pre-purchase perceived net value as a consumer¡¦s anticipation about the outcome of purchasing a product or service based on future benefits and sacrifices.
¡@Empirical modeling of the antecedents of perceived net value has been limited to benefits and sacrifices at the time of purchase. However, when consumers make a purchase decision, particularly when purchasing a durable good, they consider not only immediate situational factors, such as price and service, but also the longer-term implications of the ownership of the product. Spreng et al. (1993), in conceptualizing present perceived net value as an anticipation of future outcomes, suggested that pre-purchase sacrifice expectations would include purchase, use, repair and their psychological costs as well as the time to purchase, use and repair. However, while some of these costs could be evaluated at the time of purchase, some will not be known.
¡@Accordingly, price, product quality and in-store service quality factors identified at time of purchase influence perceived net value. However, consumers also consider the potential of longer-term losses when evaluating value relative to the purchase price. When making a purchase decision, consumers always face some concern about the performance of the product and/or service. This suggests the importance of a third factor, besides the traditional two of quality and price, namely that of perceived risk for the consumer. Precisely how these factors interact in customer purchase decision mechanisms is something which needs to be examined. Such knowledge will benefit organizations competing for superior customer value delivery. They inevitably feel compelled to build their capacity for customer value learning  and translation of their learning into action (Woodruff, 1997).

Research Methods

Model building for spa service: A decision-making framework
  Based on the work of Sweeney, Soutar, and Johnson (1999), a conceptual model of perceived net value was developed and refined, incorporating the key constituents of quality, price and risk, as presented in Figure 1. In this model, we posit that perceived quality, price and risk contribute directly to perceived net value and indirectly to willingness to buy. In the following section, the proposed model is described, and theoretical support for the hypothesized relationships is provided.

Hypotheses

The mediating influence of perceived net value on the relationship of the antecedents and consequences
¡@Zeithaml (1988) defined value as ¡§the customer¡¦s assessment of the utility of a product based on perceptions of what is received and what is given¡¨, which is perceived and defined by the customers (Bettman, Luce, & Payne, 1998; Vandermerwe, 2003). Perceptions of the dimensions of quality are viewed to be a function of a customer¡¦s prior expectations of what will and what should transpire during a service encounter, as well as the customer¡¦s most recent contact with the service delivery system (Boulding, Kalra, Staelin, & Zeuthaml, 1993). Perceived quality is defined as the consumer¡¦s overall judgment about a product¡¦s excellence or superiority (Zeithaml, 1988), and it is the benefit component of value. Service quality has long been recognized as an important strategic retailing weapon particularly in developing defensive marketing strategies between competing organizations (Spreng et al., 1993; Marshal & Murdoch, 2001; M?ller et al., 2008). The construct of service quality is not a singular but a multi-dimensional phenomenon (Vandamme & Leunis, 1993) and was found to be an important driver of behavioral intentions (Olorunniwo, Hsu, & Udo, 2006). Gronroos (1984; 1990) identified two aspects of service quality, a service¡¦s functional and technical components. Functional service quality concerns the process or the way in which service is delivered, while technical service quality relates to the outcome, or what is received from service. These perceptions of quality dimensions form the basis for a person¡¦s overall quality perception, which in turn predicts the person¡¦s intended behaviors (Boulding et al., 1993; Ozdemir & Hewett, 2010)
¡@Perceived price and perceived risk on the other hand are defined as the cost component of value; it is what the consumer gives up to obtain a product or service. This is similar in concept to Bilkey¡¦s utility model, described by Peter and Tarpey (1975), which takes into account of positive return (viz., perceived quality) and negative valences (viz., perceived price and perceived risk). Empirical modeling of the antecedents of perceived net value has been limited to benefits and sacrifices at the time of purchase. However, when consumers make a purchase decision, they consider not only immediate situational factors, such as price and service, but also the longer-term implications of the ownership of the product (viz., perceived performance or financial risk). Thus, prior research found that price, product quality and in-store service quality factors identified at time of purchase influence perceived net value. However, consumers also consider the potential of longer-term losses when evaluating value relative to the purchase price. When making a purchase decision, consumers are always faced with some concern over the performance of the product since perfect information regarding future performance is never known. Spreng et al. (1993) suggested that pre-purchase sacrifice expectations would include purchase, use, repair and psychological costs and the time to purchase, use and repair. However, while some of these costs could be evaluated at the time of purchase, some will not be known.
  Consumers consider these longer-term losses when developing perceptions of value. The inclusion of perceived risk in a value model may help to explain how perceived net value is evaluated. According to Stone and Gronhaug¡¦s (1993) conceptualization, we define perceived risk as the subjective expectation of a loss. While a number of risk dimensions have been suggested, only two are included, financial and performance risk. Each risk dimension can be viewed as an expectation of a future cost that contributes to a good¡¦s perceived net value for money at the time of purchase. Financial risk is defined as a net financial loss to a customer, including the possibility that the product may need to be repaired, replaced or the purchase price refunded. Performance risk is defined as the loss incurred when a brand or product does not perform as expected (Horton, 1976). This integrates the future quality of the product to the point of purchase. Given that risk is viewed in this study as the subjective expectation of a loss or sacrifices. 
¡@Appraisal theory spells out the antecedents and consequences of distinct affective responses. It is the cognitive appraisal of an event (e.g., perceived price), rather than the event itself (e.g., a price increase), that will trigger and emotional reaction (e.g., perceived net value or net valence), which will lead to changes in behavior (e.g., higher or lower purchase intent) (Anderson & Srinivasan, 2003; Chen & Dubinsky, 2003; Lawson & Bhagat, 2002; Pura, 2005). Perceived net value was regarded as antecedent to a person¡¦s willingness to buy and as an outcome of perceived product quality and perceived sacrifice (Monroe, 1990). The following hypotheses were developed from the above discussion:
¡@
  H1a: The perceived net value mediates the relationship between the perceived quality and willingness-to-buy.
  H1b: The perceived net value mediates the relationship between the perceived price and willingness-to-buy.
  H1c: The perceived net value mediates the relationship between the perceived risk and willingness-to-buy

The mediating influence of perceived quality on price-value relationship
¡@Several empirical explorations of the antecedents of perceived net value were helpful in providing a basis for our model. A study by Dodds, Monroe, and Grewal (1991) indicated that price not only has a negative effect on a product¡¦s value for money and people¡¦s willingness to buy on durable goods, but also has a positive effect on perceived product quality. In another word, perceived price has a dual effect. Perceived price is first a financial sacrifice and contributes negatively to perceived net value; oppositely, perceived price could influence the perceptions of quality and have a positive influence on value (Monroe, 1990), while this latter relationship has been widely discussed in the literature, even thought the relationship may not be generalized across all product types (Zeithaml, 1988). This leads to the following hypothesis:
¡@
  H2: The perceived quality mediates the relationship between the perceived price and perceived net value.

The mediating influence of perceived risk on quality-value relationship
¡@According to Stone and Gronhaug¡¦s (1993) conceptualization, we define perceived risk as the subjective expectation of a loss. While a number of risk dimensions have been suggested, only two are included, financial and performance risk. Each risk dimension can be viewed as an expectation of a future cost that contributes to a good¡¦s perceived net value for money at the time of purchase. In addition to their impact upon perceived net value, perceived product and service quality may also reduce perceived risk (Sweeney et al., 1999). Many risk reduction models have been suggested (e.g., work-of-mouth, warranties, brand image, a price-quality association and salesperson assurance) (Hawes & Lumpkin, 1986). The use of service as a risk reduction strategy in purchasing high-risk products has been recognized that how the service is delivered (functional service quality) and what is received from the service (technical service quality) may reduce risk. The above discussion suggests the following hypothesis:
¡@
    H3: The perceived risk mediates the relationship between the perceived quality and perceived net value.

Data collection and measurement
  As in our previous study, data collection occurred in two stages. In the first stage, a draft questionnaire was developed and pretested to improve the validity of the scales. The coefficient alphas of all dimensions in the pretested questionnaire were over .6, indicating that they had acceptable internal consistency and reliability (Nunnally, 1970). In the second stage, a survey was then conducted and the empirical data were collected from customers at different spa hotels in four major spa regions of Taiwan. Participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire using 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Our aim was to use the questionnaire to assess customers¡¦ overall agreement regarding perceived quality, perceived price, perceived risk, perceived net value, and their willingness to pay for the spa service at a hotel, rather than their experience at any particular hotel. In the survey, there were some negatively revised items to verify that all of the questions were answered properly. Finally, 200 valid samples (95% of those surveyed), were successfully collected in 2006 and included in the subsequent data analysis. 

Empirical Results

Factor analysis
¡@As in our previous study, table 1 shows the results of the factor analysis. The results of principal component analysis indicated that there were 7 factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 (representing 7 dimensions in all 5 constructs), cumulatively explaining a total of 71.24% of the variance. It was found that each item loaded on their respective factor with loadings greater than .50. Moreover, the results of reliability analysis indicated that the Cronbach¡¦s coefficient alpha of the multi-item measures was .80, and that of constructs ranged between .75 and .92, which suggested the acceptability of all measurements in terms of internal consistency. 

<Table 1 inserts here>

Validity analysis
¡@To test the convergent and discriminant validities of our instrument, we calculated the average variance extracted (AVE) and constructed a correlation matrix for the constructs (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; Hulland, 1999). Convergent validity is adequate when the values of AVE are greater than .50, and discriminant validity is satisfactory when the square roots of AVE are greater than inter-construct correlations (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). Table 2 shows the means, standard deviations, correlations, and square roots of AVE for all constructs. As can be seen, all values of AVE were greater than .50, and square roots of AVE on the main diagonal were greater than the off-diagonal elements in the corresponding rows and columns of the matrix. Thus, the results clearly indicate good convergent and discriminant validities.
¡@Common method variance is assumed if the results of principle component analysis show a single factor emerging from unrotated factor solutions, or a first factor explains the majority of the variance (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Lee, 2003). Since all items in our questionnaire were completed by single respondents, Harmar¡¦s one factor test was conducted to detect possible common method variance by entering all items together into a principle component analysis (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). The results indicated that neither did a single factor emerge nor did the first factor explain the majority of the variance. Thus, common method variance did not seem to be a problem in our sample data.

Hypothesis testing
¡@To test the mediation effects in this study, a structural regression model was constructed for our conceptual model (as presented in figure 2). Cohen and Cohen (1983) stated that if all path coefficients of independent variable both to dependent variable and to mediator, and that of mediator to dependent variable are statistically significant at the same level of alpha, then the partial mediation effect can be taken as statistically significant at the same level of alpha too. However, if the direct effect between independent and dependent variables is not statistically significant, then the hypothesis of ¡§pure¡¨ mediation (completely mediation) between two variables is supported (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Kline, 2011; Shrout & Bolger, 2002). 
¡@According to the results of the structural regression model, two indirect effects was found that perceived quality was significantly and positively associated with willingness to buy (£]=.38, P<.001), and perceived price was significantly and negatively associated with willingness to buy (£]=-.40, P<.001), given the significantly direct effects of quality-value (£]=.35, P<.001), price-value (£]=-.32, P<.001), and value-willingness (£]=.17, P<.01). Thus, based on the results in figure 2, we find that perceived net value significantly and partially mediates the relationships between perceived quality and willingness to buy, and the relationships between perceived price and willingness to buy (all path coefficients were statistically significant at the same level of alpha, p<.01). Therefore, Hypotheses 1a and 1b were partially supported. However, perceived net value does not mediate the relationship between perceived risk and willingness to buy because the direct and indirect effects of perceived risk to perceived net value (£]=-.10, ns) and to willingness to buy (£]=-.11, ns) are not statistically significant respectively. Thus, Hypothesis 1c was not supported. 
¡@Additionally, perceived quality also significantly and partially mediates the relationship between perceived price and perceived net value, given the indirect effect of price-value (£]=-.32, P<.001), and direct effects of price-quality (£]=.24, P<.001) and quality-value (£]=.35, P<.01) (all path coefficients were statistically significant at the same level of alpha, p<.001), but perceived risk does not mediate the relationships between perceived quality and perceived net value because the direct effect of perceived risk to perceived net value (£]=-.10, ns) is not statistically significant. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was partially supported, but Hypothesis 3 was not supported.

Discussion

Conclusions and managerial implications
¡@This work clarified the relationships and processes in the conceptual model of perceived net value. Three major conclusions were reached. First of all, perceived net value partially mediates both the relationship between perceived quality and willingness-to-buy, and the relationship between perceived price and willingness-to-buy, suggesting that customers consider only perceived quality and perceived price, the immediate situational factors of benefits and sacrifices, particularly when purchasing a spa service product, that will trigger an emotional reaction (e.g., perceived net value or net valence), which will lead to changes in behavior (H1a and H1b). Secondly, the hypothesized mediating influence of perceived quality on the relationship between perceived price and perceived net value was partially supported indicating higher perceived price represents higher perceived quality, which leads to higher perceived net value (H2). The verification of H1b and H2 also confirmed the dual effects of perceived price to perceived net value and perceived quality in the service domain. Finally, however, perceived net value does not mediate the risk-willingness relationship (H1c) and neither does perceived risk mediate the quality-value relationship (H3), which, taken together, are consistent with the findings of Rao and Monroe¡¦s (1989) meta-analysis that the phenomenon had only been supported for moderately priced, frequently purchased goods as opposed to higher priced, infrequently purchased goods. The findings provided managers directions that sales promotion in today¡¦s world of intense competition in spa hotel industry, should focus on increasing customer value by improving the customer perceptions of overall product and service quality with the setting of quality standards, and by providing customers preferential treatment in price.
¡@
Limitations and future research
¡@In this study we developed a conceptual model, taking perceived quality, perceived relative price and perceived risk into account as antecedents to perceived net value, which in turn affect consumers¡¦ willingness to buy. However, this preliminary attempt had a number of limitations, which also suggested new directions for future studies. First of all, in this study we focused on the relationships among service-related factors in the spa hotel industry. Given the great diversity of service industries, these findings may have to be tested in different service industries. Secondly, the current findings could be confirmed by further evidence from other countries given the difference in values and cultures among different countries and domains. 
¡@Further research will be needed to assess the link between perceived net value and willingness-to-buy, and the contents of the antecedent to perceived net value, remains tenuous, in spite of limited empirical evidence currently available. Therefore, further research should keep investigating the potential constructs into account such as satisfaction, loyalty (Hu et al., 2009) and relational benefits (Gwinner, Gremler, & Bitner, 1998). In addition, as Ruiz et al. (2007) suggested, future research should attempt to explain market heterogeneity in customers¡¦ perceptions of value. In particular, how special treatment by the service provider, the level of customer¡¦s involvement and accumulated experience, for instance, may act as predictors of market heterogeneity in the customer¡¦s perceptions of value with a service setting.
