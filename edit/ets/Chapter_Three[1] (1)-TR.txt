Figure 3-1: The research structure of the study
Routes of Research Concepts
Route 1: Explores the differences in learning anxiety with respect to student background variables.
Route 2: Explores the differences in learning motivation with respect to student background variables.
Route 3: Explores the differences in learning attitude with respect to student background variables.
Route 4: Probe the relationship between learning anxiety and learning motivation.
Route 5: Probe the relationship between learning motivation and learning attitudes.
Route 6: Probe the relationship between learning anxiety and learning attitudes.

3-1 The Research Design divided the variables being considered into four groups: Background Variables, and Learning 
Anxiety, Learning Motivation, Learning Attitude Variables. Background Variables were idependent variables. Learning Anxiety, Learning Motivation, and Learning Attitude were result variables. The purpose of the study was to probe the differences Background Variables have on Learning Anxiety, Learning Motivation, and Learning Attitude.   

Data on the variables was collected from students in the form of a questionnaire developed by the author. A pilot study was run and the questionnaire revised on the basis of the results of validity (subject experts' evaluations and factor analysis) and reliability (Cronbach's alpha) tests. The questionnaire was then distributed and data collected. t-tests and a one way ANOVA were run on the data.

Research Hypotheses 
  According to the purpose of study and research questions, five hypotheses are presented as follows:
Hypothesis 1: There is no relationship between the English learning anxiety of vocational high school students and their different majors.
Hypothesis 2: There is no relationship between the English learning motivation of vocational high school students and their different majors.
Hypothesis 3: There is no relationship between the English learning attitude of vocational high school students and their different majors.  
Hypothesis 4: There is no relationship between the English learning purposes of vocational high school students and their different majors.  
Hypothesis 5: There is no relationship between the choice of career as the reason individual vocational high school students are learning English and their different majors.
Hypothesis 6: There is no relationship between the choice of academic advancement as the reason individual vocational high school students are learning English and their different majors.

Instruments
¡@A survey was used to investigate the English learning situation of vocational high school students. A questionnaire was developed using sources from the literature and learning observations. The researcher used the survey to collect data.
   The questionnaire consisted of four parts. The first part sought background information. The second part asked for learning anxiety self reports. The third part was for motivation self reports. The fourth part was self-reported learning attitudes. The researcher adopted items from Hsu (2003). Participants responded to the questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The points were, 5 points¡ "strongly disagree," 4 points¡¨ disagree,¡§ 3 points¡§neutral,¡¨2 points ¡§agree,¡§ and 1 point ¡§strongly agree.¡¨ Referenced in its construction were Chu (2006), and Su (2011).
Pilot study
Questionnaire:
¡@The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first part measured learning anxiety, the second part learning motivation and the third part learning attitudes. The questionnaire was developed by the researcher after consulting the literature. The preliminary draft of the questionnaire included learning anxiety, motivation and attitude scales. Then experts assessed content validity and the instrument was revised to prepare for the pilot study questionnaire survey. The pilot study location was National Chia-yi Industrial Vocational High School.	
1. Pilot study sample count: The pilot study subjects were from the same or similar population as the formal study
and were representative of Taiwanese vocational high school students. There were at least 100 ( ¤ý¤å¬ì, 1990). The number surveyed in the pilot study was 120. 
2. Sampling: The pilot study questionnaire survey depended on convenience sampling of school classes, choosing the pilot study students. Students were males 40 and females 40. The total surveyed numbered about 120 (Table3-1). Each class received 40 copies of the questionnaire. The total number of questionnaires distributed was 120. The invalid questionnaires returned numbered 15. The valid questionnaires represented 87% of the total.

Formal study
1. Item selection and survey methods
Items from the pilot study's questionnaire were kept or dropped on the basis of a factor analysis and reliability analysis to test the individuals items' reliability and validity. The suitable items constituted the formal questionnaire. The formal questionnaire was distributed to students in six classes in four departments. The classes each had about 25 males and 15 females, for a total of 40 students in each class. The total number of students surveyed was 240. (Table 3-2)  


For Table 3-3 see the Word docx file.


2. Research sample and data collection
The formal study followed the pattern of the pilot study, recycling valid and reliable items from its questionnaire and adding basic background data questions. This data included gender, department, school English course load, English Interest, English learning purpose, College admission plans, and English Learning methods.

Learning anxiety scale 
Content:
The sale measures Learning Anxiety, Test Anxiety, and Negative Evaluation Anxiety 
Respondents and Scoring methods:
Participants responded to the questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale, with 5 points representing "strongly disagree."4 points¡¨ disagree,¡§ 3 points¡§neutral,¡¨2 points ¡§agree,¡§ and 1 point ¡§strongly agree.¡¨
 Method of development:
¡@The scale is the instrument used to assess the students' self-perceived language anxiety.
The literature review provided a basis in theory. The three aspects of anxiety it measures are Learning Anxiety, Test Anxiety, and Negative Evaluation Anxiety. Two experts and five teachers who teach in college and senior high school were asked to provide expert validity analysis. They all had doctoral or master's degrees.      
  The Learning Motivation Scale is the instrument used to assess the students' self-reported motivation.
The literature review again provided a basis in theory. Its two sections measure Extrinsic
Motivation and Intrinsic Motivation. Two experts and five teachers who teach in college and senior high school were asked to provide expert validity analysis. They all had doctoral or master's degrees.
  The Learning Attitude Scale is the instrument used to assess the students' self-reported attitudes.
The literature review again provided a basis in theory. Its two sections measure Extracurricular and School Curriculum. Two experts and five teachers who teach in college and senior high school were asked to provide expert validity analysis. They all had doctoral or master's degrees.

Research and Data Collection Procedure
¡@The procedure of the study consisted of five steps. First, the researcher reviewed the relevant studies and developed the questionnaire. Second, she investigated the validity and reliability of the questionnaire; a pilot study was conducted with students in National Chia-yi Industrial Vocational High School. Third, the questionnaire was revised for the formal data collection stage to investigate the research questions. Fourth, the data was analyzed and the research results and conclusions written up. Finally, suggestions for further research were written .




Data analysis
¡@The data collected from the students¡¦ responses to the questionnaire were collated and SPSS was used to analyze the results. The data analysis steps are as follows. First, the researcher removed the incomplete, or otherwise invalid, questionnaire responses. Second, the valid questionnaire data was entered in the computer. Third, the correctness of all the data was checked.
¡@The statistical analysis proceeded as follows. First, the means and standard deviations of the vocational high school students' responses were calculated to determine if they supported the Research Hypotheses. Second, t-tests were run to understand if differences in the responses were statistically significant. Third, a one-way ANOVA was computed to test whether the purpose for which the students were learning English made a difference to the relationship between the students' major and their learning anxiety, learning motivation and learning attitude.

Editor notes:

Sentences, clauses that appeared twice and required changing to be acceptable:
a. Anxiety: a state of apprehension, a vague fear that is only indirectly associated with an object (Hilgard, Atkinson, & Atkinson, 1971)
b. The "subjective feeling of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry associated with an arousal of the autonomic nervous system." Due to Spielberger, or Horwitz?.
	- I found another definition ascribed to Spielberger on the Internet and replaced the above definition with that one.
c. Han (2009) investigated the study of vocational high school students¡¦ English learning motivation, learning style, learning strategy and learning achievement. The results of her study showed that students were extrinsically motivated.
	- I replaced that sentence the second time with: Han (2009) and a number of the other studies reported above discuss the relationships between anxiety, motivation and attitudes."

Inconsistencies:
Males numbered 20 and females 20. The total surveyed in the pilot study numbered about 120. ?? 20 + 20 doesn't equal 120.
Students are males 40 and females 40.The total survey people are about 120 (Table3-1). ?? Now the numbers are larger but don't equal 120.
Tables:

a. I corrected Table 3.1, 3.2 in the Word docx file.
References:

Questionable references that are not cited in the text and have no relevance to anxiety, motivation and attitudes, eg Campo et al, (2008), and Cardy et al, (1996), need to be removed.

(cited by Horwitz, 1986, p.156). Is this the right page number? None of Horwitz's 1986 publications appear to have a page 156.

Or is it this:

Not in the list of references.
Not all the references cited in the text are listed in the references at the end, eg Scovel, 1978. Horwitz et al, 1986.

Advice:

1. There is no Discussion and Conclusions section. The author may add this later. But already in the Introduction and Literature Review sections, the author needs to explain why/how she thinks anxiety affects attitudes and motivation. He/she needs to contribute new ideas to the academic study of language learning to make the paper worthwhile. She needs to try to explain, for example, why some high achievers still feel anxiety. She needs to explain how anxiety, motivation and attitudes develop over time and how the relationship between the three changes over time, for example. She needs to explain why students with different majors might show differences.
2. There needs to be an engagement with the ideas of researchers he/she quotes. He/she needs to make claims, and assertions about the mechanisms by which anxiety has its effects. In other words, he/she needs to express his/her own opinion, and agree or disagree with Horwitz, or someone.
