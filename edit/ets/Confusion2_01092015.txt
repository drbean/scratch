An Empirical Study of the Antecedents and Consequences of Consumer Confusion in the Taiwanese Retailing Context

Abstract
  In the last few decades, Taiwan has achieved the Asia-Pacific and perhaps the world¡¦s highest density of convenience stores. Consumers have benefited from the rapidly increasing number of convenience stores and the intense competitive environment that has resulted. However, consumers also face an overabundance of information and a large variety of alternatives among overly similar, extremely complex, and ambiguously-differentiated products and services. To advance our understanding of consumer confusion, we propose a model identifying the dimensions of consumer confusion, its antecedents and the consequences in the context of the Taiwanese convenience store industry. Two sets of sample data were collected from southern and central areas of Taiwan. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the first sample to identify different constructs of our conceptual model, and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the second sample to test the reliability and validity of the model. Empirical data analyses indicated that both similarity confusion and overload confusion mediate the relationship between the antecedent variables (viz., stimuli and store knowledge) and the consequence variables (viz., decision postponement and inertia). However, ambiguity confusion does not meditate the relationship between antecedents and consequences.

1. Introduction
¡@In the last few decades, consumers have witnessed an explosive growth of convenience stores in Taiwan. According to statistics released by the Fair Trade Commission in Taiwan, the number of convenience stores in the country increased from 5,674 in 2000 to more than 10,000 in 2012. Total combined sales of all the convenience stores had reached approximately US$7.59 billion with more than 2.7 billion customer visits annually as of the end of 2010. Accordingly, Taiwan has achieved the Asia-Pacific and perhaps the world¡¦s highest density of convenience stores (Hsu, 2012; Wu and Hsu, 2012). 
¡@The rapidly increasing number of convenience stores and the intense competition between the different convenience store chains has generated tremendous benefits and welfare gains for consumers in Taiwan (Wu and Hsu, 2012). However, consumers also face a surfeit of information and a difficult choice between alternatives, as a result of the very similar, very complex, and ambiguously-differentiated products and services (Hebeisen, 2012; Rudolph et al., 2003). In fact, consumer confusion is already central to the study of consumer behavior (Walsh et al, 2007), and this phenomenon can now also be observed in the Taiwan retailing industry (Chen and Chang, 2013).
¡@In highly competitive environments, understanding consumer behavior is very important to a company. Good communication can prevent customers from becoming frustrated and seeking other business options (Hebeisen, 2012). In markets characterized by complexity of products and excessive information, looking at the nature of consumer confusion enhances not only our understanding of the causes and outcomes of consumer behavior, but also helps managers build good relationships with their customers, and improves marketing strategies for both wholesalers and retailers (Turnbull et al., 2000).
¡@In this study, the author identifies the dimensions of consumer confusion, its antecedents and the consequences in the context of the Taiwanese convenience store industry. 
2. Literature Review
2.1 Consumer confusion
¡@Consumer confusion has been a central topic in the marketing and consumer research literature in the last few decades. Some scholars have proposed a few formal definitions of consumer confusion. For example, Sproles and Kendall (1986) argued that ¡§Consumers perceive many brands and stores from which to choose and have difficulty making choices. Furthermore, they experience overload¡¨. Mitchell and Papavassiliou (1999) also stated that ¡§confusion is a state of mind which affects information processing and decision making. The consumer may therefore be aware or unaware of confusion¡¨. Similarly, Turnbull et al. (2000) also defined consumer confusion as ¡§consumer failure to develop a correct interpretation of various facets of a product/service during the information processing procedure¡¨. For Walsh et al. (2007), consumer confusion can be viewed as ¡§a condition that individuals may be prone to and which causes them to act differently and/or affects their decision making behavior¡¨. And in a current definition proposed by Edward and Sahadev (2012), ¡§consumer confusion is an uncomfortable psychological state consumers experience when exposed to an overload of marketing information which is often very similar, misleading, ambiguous and inadequate in nature¡¨.
¡@Regarding the dimensions of consumer confusion, the extant literature on consumer confusion focuses mainly on three different types: similarity, overload, and ambiguity confusion (Mitchell and Papavassiliou, 1999; Turnbull et al, 2000; Walsh et al, 2007). Similarity confusion is defined as a lack of understanding and potential alteration of a customer¡¦s choice or an incorrect choice caused by the perceived physical similarity of products or services. Overload confusion is defined as a lack of understanding caused by the customer being confronted with an overly information-rich environment that cannot be processed in the time available to fully understand, and be confident in, the purchase environment. Finally, ambiguity confusion is defined as a lack of understanding during which customers are forced to re-evaluate and revise current beliefs or assumptions about products or the purchasing environment (Howard et al., 2000; Mitchell et al., 2005; Schweizer et al., 2006; Walsh et al, 2007).
2.2 Stimuli
¡@A number of factors have been identified as main stimuli leading to consumer confusion (Mitchell and Papavassiliou, 1999; Ward and Loken, 1986). These stimuli factors may arise because of the marketer¡¦s activities, such as advertising, promotion, and store environment, or it may be generated by the customer¡¦s own sources, such as interpersonal communication (Walsh et al., 2007). Wang and Shukla (2013) argue that increased advertising ¡§clutter¡¨ is likely to cause memory inaccuracies, which accentuate the problem of similarity confusion and affect the quality of the customer¡¦s decision making. When consumers are confronted with too much information from advertising and promotion, or the store environment elements create negative consumer feeling during shopping, consumer confusion can be triggered (D¡¦Astous, 2000; Walsh and Mitchell, 2005). Therefore, consumer confusion resulting from a set of stimuli is primarily composed of: advertising and promotion, store environment, and interpersonal communication (Schweizer et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2007).
2.3 Store knowledge
¡@When consumers choose products in the store, their behavior is usually based on their own memories of the product, their search for product information or their experience of the use of similar products. Olavarrieta et al. (2012) argued shoppers do have a strong interest in keeping a knowledge base of prices for products they purchase but not for all products due to information overload, product category proliferation, and cognitive and memory constraints. The provision of knowledge education is based on the premise increasing customers¡¦ knowledge about available options will generally increase their tendency to choose wisely, but it is important to distinguish confidence in one¡¦s knowledge from confidence in one¡¦s decisions (Hadar et al., 2013). Particularly relevant to our interests is the knowledge that accrues from the sensory experience that accompanies consumption. A customer with no prior consumption experience in a product category has little knowledge about the array of experiences available, the variability of these experiences, and the dimensions by which to evaluate and appreciate these experiences (Clarkson et al., 2013).
2.4 Decision postponement
¡@When consumers confront confusion, they will employ several confusion reduction strategies (Huffman and Kahn, 1998). Mitchell and Papavassiou (1999) argued decision postponement is one of the most important forms of reduction strategy that consumers frequently apply. Decision postponement reflects consumers¡¦ awareness of the confusion involved in their decision making. The confused consumer will respond to the cognitive strain by delaying his/her purchase behavior, and he/she may ask a salesperson or seek additional information (Walsh et al., 2007). Therefore, many scholars have suggested that decision postponement is very important in assessing the consequences of consumer confusion (Drummond, 2004; Mitchell and Papavassiliou, 1997; Walsh and Mitchell, 2010).
2.5 Inertia
¡@Consumer inertia is the repetition of purchasing behavior undertaken passively and without much thought (White and Yanamandram, 2004). Inertia is characterized as a habitual attachment that is to a large extent unemotional and convenience-driven (Gounaris and Stathakopoulos, 2004; Lee and Cunningham, 2001). Inert consumers are typified as inactive or passive, and they tend to avoid making new purchasing decisions, or avoid learning new service routines and practices (Bozzo, 2002). Inertia can be either behavior-based inertia or cognitive-based inertia (Oliver, 1999; Oreg, 2003; Piderit, 2000). Behavioral inertia reflects continuance of a buying behavior simply because it is what the consumers have always done. This may or may not indicate the presence of a genuine subconscious habit. Cognitive inertia implies that consumers consciously continue a purchasing decision even though they are aware that it might not necessary be the best, or most efficient (Barnes et al., 2004; Rumelt, 1995). Meanwhile, Polites and Karahanna (2012) argued that when consumers are under stress or emotionally depressed, they tend to persist in their buying behavior using prior experiences as their guide and doing what they have always done in the past. Restriction in consumers¡¦ cognitive ability to process information may lead to more depression. As a result, such consumers will exhibit more habitual behavior (Schweizer et al., 2006). 
3. Research Method
3.1 Model building for consumer confusion: A decision-making framework
¡@To understand consumer confusion in the Taiwan convenience stores context, we propose a model of the antecedents and consequences of consumer confusion. In this model, we argue that stimuli and store knowledge can cause customer confusion, which in turn affects decision postponement and inertia (as presented in figure 3.1). In the following section, each of the constructs in the proposed model is described and the theoretical support for the hypothesized relationships is set forth.

3.2 Hypotheses
Antecedents of consumer confusion
¡@Prior studies revealed that confusion is caused by several stimuli, including advertising and promotion, store environment, and interpersonal communication (Drummond, 2004; Mitchell et al., 2005; Schweizer et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2007). Information relating to products and services aims not only at informing but also persuading consumers to make a specific choice (Cohen, 1999). However, consumers are now subjected to a combination of plentiful and conflicting information, a very large number of brands, and confusing product replications. This overload in information is often the results of excessive, overly similar, and outright ambiguous marketing and promotion activities (Golodner, 1993; Huffman and Kahn, 1998; Leek and Kun, 2006). Wang and Shukla (2013) argued that consumers are often confronted with ambiguous product claims and advertising messages. Some are even created strategically by the producers to preserve their options, being deliberately vague in order to ¡§have it both ways¡¨. Unclarity focuses on the quality of information instead of the quantity of information, leading to confused customers. Furthermore, the role of atmospherics and the overall physical store environment appears to be important to consumer confusion (Mitchell et al., 2005). Many stores periodically change the position of product categories and the layout of the store in order to expose consumers to a wider range of products. However, this constant product moving, combined with poor signage and the placing of many products with similar brands on the shelves, will increase consumer confusion (Mitchell et al., 2005). 
¡@In addition to stimuli, store knowledge is also believed to be an important factor that contributes to consumer confusion (Brengman, Geuens, and Pelsmacker, 2001; Ludwick et al., 1999). Brengman et al. (2001) argued that knowledgeable consumers are less likely to thoroughly compare the products they buy regularly. Although they consider a greater number of information dimensions, they look at fewer brand alternatives, and knowledge obtained from prior experience reduces the scope of their search behavior (Jacoby, 1997; Neisser, 1976). However, in the context of rapid growth and excessive competition between convenience store chains, consumers are confronted by products and services of greater similarity (Matzler et al. 2011). As consumers gain knowledge about these store chains, they face information overload, the need to evaluate ever greater numbers of choice alternatives, and the greater cognitive demands of dealing with more complexity and variety in different product categories. Hence, they should become more susceptible to confusion (Foxman et al., 1990; Mitchell et al., 2005). Therefore, the above discussion suggests the following hypotheses:
H1a: The greater the stimuli, the greater the similarity confusion.
H1b: The greater the stimuli, the greater the overload confusion.
H1c: The greater the stimuli, the greater the ambiguity confusion.
H2a: The greater the store knowledge, the greater the similarity confusion.
H2b: The greater the store knowledge, the greater the overload confusion.
H2c: The greater the store knowledge, the greater the ambiguity confusion.
Consequences of consumer confusion
¡@Consumers who experience confusion regularly across different products categories are likely to become more frustrated with and tired of shopping (Mitchell et al., 2005). Warlop and Alba (2004) argued, from a consumer welfare perspective, similarity and substitutability are not isomorphic, and the ability of a copycat to detract from an incumbent is a calibration issue involving the degree of customer price sensitivity and the trade-off between the size of the price differential and the many advantages enjoyed by the incumbent (e.g., familiarity and reputation). If customers are confronted with process-related unclarity, they lack the capabilities to cope with the challenges regarding the configuration task. Consequently, they can neither design a fitting product specification, nor are they satisfied by the configuration process (Matzler et al., 2011). Shukla et al. (2010) also argued, once consumers get confused, they find it difficult to select, interpret and evaluate stimuli, thus confused consumers will develop different strategies to respond to their confusion. They may abandon the purchase, seek additional information, clarify the buying goals, or delay their purchase decision (Matzler et al., 2007). 
¡@Walsh et al. (2007) suggested that the importance of consumer confusion is ultimately assessed in their consequences and their economic impact on companies. Although several consequence variables of consumer confusion have been discussed in the previous literature, a number of scholars have claimed that decision postponement is an effective strategy that consumers mostly employ (Jacoby and Morrin, 1998; Huffman and Kahn, 1998; Mitchell and Papavassiliou, 1999; Walsh et al., 2007). Decision postponement implies that ¡§the confusion is at a higher level than can be dealt with at that time. This deliberate delay of a specific purchase, allows the consumer time to compare alternatives, clarify purchase goals and evaluate any information gathered¡¨ (Walsh et al., 2005). In addition, in a highly complex environment, when consumers have difficulty distinguishing between a variety of products and services, and they cannot deal with the information overload, consumers will rely more on their past choices to make buying decisions (Bawa, 1990; Bem, 1972). As inertia sets in, the volume and diversity of information processing tends to decrease. Consumers will rely on their past behavior to guide their perceptions and intentions. As a result, when consumers get confused, they strive to reduce suffering from cognitive dissonance by continuing their prior habitual behaviors (Polites and Karahanna, 2012). Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:
H3a: The greater the similarity confusion, the greater the decision postponement.
H3b: The greater the similarity confusion, the greater the inertia.
H4a: The greater the overload confusion, the greater the decision postponement.
H4b: The greater the overload confusion, the greater the inertia.
H5a: The greater the ambiguity confusion, the greater the decision postponement.
H5b: The greater the ambiguity confusion, the greater the inertia.
The mediating effect of consumer confusion
¡@Prior studies have discussed the antecedents and consequences of consumer confusion; however a detailed examination of the mediation effect of consumer confusion seems not to have been carried out in the previous literature. Based on the findings of previous researchers, Mitchell et al. (2005) argued that consumer confusion is the result of several antecedent factors, and it is also the causes of several consequences. In particular, internal and external sources like various types of advertising and media messages are usually the main sources of consumer confusion, and when this confusion is experienced by consumers, several reduction strategies will be employed by consumers (Devasenathipathi and Saravanan, 2012). Such prior explorations of the antecedents and consequences of consumer confusion are helpful in providing a basis for the examination of the mediating effect of consumer confusion (Wang and Shukla, 2013). In our conceptual model, we link stimuli and store knowledge to the three types of confusion, which in turn are connected to decision postponement and inertia. Besides the direct effects, the mediating effect of consumer confusion between the antecedent and consequence factors were also empirically tested in our study. Thus we propose the following hypotheses:
H6a: Similarity confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and decision postponement.
H6b: Similarity confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and inertia.
H6c: Similarity confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and decision postponement.
H6d: Similarity confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and inertia
H7a: Overload confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and decision postponement.
H7b: Overload confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and inertia.
H7c: Overload confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and decision postponement.
H7d: Overload confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and inertia.
H8a: Ambiguity confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and decision postponement.
H8b: Ambiguity confusion mediates the relationship between stimuli and inertia.
H8c: Ambiguity confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and decision postponement.
H8d: Ambiguity confusion mediates the relationship between store knowledge and inertia.
3.3 Sample and data collection
¡@The study managed empirical data collection in two sampling stages. The first set of data was collected in a preliminary survey in southern Taiwan in August, 2014. An exploratory factor analysis was used on this data to check the appropriateness of the conceptual model. Participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire with 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to measure the degree to which customers exhibited all seven constructs. Among the 300 questionnaires issued, 156 valid samples (approximately 51.7%) were successfully collected. Represented were 70 males (45.2% of the sample) and 85 females (54.8%). About 76.1% of the respondents held college degrees, 18.1% held graduate degrees or above, and the remaining 5.8% had a secondary school education. Approximately 77.1% of the respondents were less than 40 years old. The participants were grouped into the following categories by monthly income: less than NT$ 20,000 (53 respondents, 34.2% of the sample), NT$20,001~ NT$40,000 (35, 22.6%), NT$40,001~ NT$60,000 (32, 20.6%), NT$60,001 or above (35, 22.6%). A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sampling adequacy measure of .78 indicated an acceptable level of factorability for the factor analysis. Bartlett¡¦s test of sphericity, which tests whether the correlation matrix is an identity matrix, is significant (p <.000). This indicates that the conceptual model was adequate for the exploratory factor analyses and reliability analyses.
¡@To assess the validity of the constructs and to examine the proposed relationships in our conceptual model of consumer confusion, we conducted the second survey in central Taiwan in December, 2014. Participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire revised from that of the preliminary survey. Among the 500 questionnaires issued, 349 valid responses (approximately 69.8%) were successfully collected for further data analysis. Represented were 157 males (45% of the sample) and 192 females (55%). About 85.4% of the respondents held college degrees, 10.3% held graduate degrees or above, and the remaining 4.3% had a secondary school education. Approximately 87.8% of the respondents were less than 40 years old. The participants were grouped into the following categories by monthly income: less than NT$ 20,000 (89 respondents, 25.5% of the samples), NT$20,001~ NT$40,000 (163, 46.7%), NT$40,001~ NT$60,000 (51, 14.6%), NT$60,001 or above (46, 13.2%).
3.4 Measures
Stimuli. According to Carol (1986), the stimulus construct consists of three dimensions, namely, advertising and promotion, store environment, and interpersonal communication (Schweizer, Kotouc, and Wagner, 2006). To measure different aspects of the stimuli, nine items representing the three dimensions were taken from the literature and edited. Sample items included ¡§I obtain product and service information through the advertising and promotion activity of the convenience stores¡¨, ¡§The convenience store environments are clean and comfortable¡¨, and ¡§I often adopt my friends¡¦ opinions when I consider buying products and services from convenience stores¡¨ (Wang and Shukla, 2013).
Store knowledge. We asked the respondents to rate two aspects of their store knowledge. The first dimension was customer¡¦s knowledge about brand image and product attributes, measured by three items (Clarkson et al. 2013; Hadar, Sood, and Fox, 2013). A sample item was ¡§I can distinguish the brand images of the different convenience stores¡¨. The second dimension was customer¡¦s personal experience and knowledge about different convenience stores, measured by three items (Clarkson et al. 2013; Olavarrieta et al. 2012). A sample item was ¡§I understand the marketing styles of the different convenience stores based on my past consumer experiences¡¨.
Customer confusion. To measure the three different dimensions of customer confusion, nine items were taken from the consumer confusion literature and edited. Three items were used to capture similarity confusion (Walsh et al. 2007). A sample item was ¡§Sometimes I want to buy a product seen in an advertisement, but cannot identify it clearly from among the scores of similar products¡¨. Three items were used to measure overload confusion (Matzler, Stieger, and Fuller, 2011). A sample item was ¡§There are so many brands to choose from that I sometime feel confused¡¨. And three items were used to evaluate ambiguity confusion (Walsh and Mitchell, 2008). A sample item was ¡§When purchasing certain products, I feel uncertain as to the product features that are particularly important to me¡¨.
Decision postponement. We used Walsh et al.¡¦s (2007) three-item scale to measure customer¡¦s decision postponement. A sample item was ¡§sometimes it is difficult to arrive at a decision when making a purchase¡¨.
Inertia. Two dimensions were measured to capture inertia (Oreg, 2003; Anderson and Srinivasan, 2003). Affective-based inertia was measured using three items (Barnes et al. 2004). A sample item was ¡§I continue buying products and services from familiar convenience stores because I am comfortable doing so¡¨. Behavioral-based inertia was also measured using three items (Gupta et al. 2004; Piderit, 2000). A sample item was ¡§I continue buying products and services from familiar convenience stores, simply because it is what I have always done¡¨.
Control variables. Several demographic characteristics of the respondents were controlled in our analysis. Gender was coded with 0 indicating female and 1 indicating male. Education was measured using three categories (0=secondary or below; 1=college or university, and 2=graduate school or above). Age was measured based on five categories (0=under 20, 1=21-30, 2=31-40, 3=41-50, and 4=51 or above). Monthly income was measured using four categories (0=under NT$20,000, 1=NT$20,001~ NT$40,000, 2=NT$40,001~ NT$60,000, and 3=NT$60,001 or above).
4. Empirical Results
4.1 Exploratory factor analysis
¡@Items of all constructs in the questionnaire were taken from the advanced literature review and revised. To make sure that the measurements of the scales were a psychometrically appropriate instrument, an exploratory factor analysis was adopted on the first sampling data (n=156) using the maximum likelihood method with varimax rotation. Table 4.1 shows the results of the exploratory factor analyses. The results reveal there are 11 factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 (representing 11 dimensions in all of 7 constructs), cumulatively explaining a total of 71.51% of the variance. It was found that each item loaded on their respective factor with loadings greater than .50. Internal consistency reliability for the factors ranged from .70 to .90, indicating good reliability.

4.2 Confirmatory factor analyses
¡@Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used to test whether the data fit a hypothesized measurement model on the second sample data (n=349) by using AMOS. Overall model fit was assessed by goodness of fit indices including chi square to?degree of freedom?ratio (£q2/d.f.), goodness of fit index (GFI), comparative fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). A reasonable model is indicated when £q2/d.f. is below 3 (Kline, 1998), GFI, CFA, NFI, and TLI are above .90, and the RMSEA is below .08 (Hair et al., 2010; Hu and Bentler, 1998; Saris et al., 1987). Table 4.2 shows the results of the CFAs. All constructs and hypothesized model show satisfied goodness of fit indices indicating the conceptual model fits the data reasonably well. The overall model fit of our conceptual model shows that chi-square was 169.37 with 53 degrees of freedom, GFI was .93, CFI was .91, NFI was .91, TLI was .90, and RMSEA was .07, all these indices satisfied the thresholds, thus our conceptual model fitted the data reasonably well.

P-value for £q2 statistic is less than 0.001
¡@To test the convergent and discriminant validities of our measure, we calculated the average variance extracted (AVE) and conducted a correlation matrix between the constructs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hulland, 1999). Convergent validity is adequate when the values of AVE are greater than .50, and discriminant validity is suitable when the square root of AVE are greater than inter-construct correlations (Hair et al. 2010). Table 4.3 shows the means, standard deviations, correlations, and square root of AVE for all constructs. The results indicated that all values of AVE were greater than .50, and square root of AVE on the main diagonal were greater than the off-diagonal elements in the corresponding rows and columns of the matrix. Thus, the results clearly indicate good convergent and discriminant validities.

¡@* Correlation is significant at the .05 level (2-tailed).
¡@Common method variance is assumed if the results of principle component analysis show a single factor emerging from unrotated factor solutions, or a first factor explains the majority of the variance (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, and Lee, 2003). Since all items in our questionnaire were completed by a single respondent, Harmar¡¦s one factor test was conducted to detect possible common method variance by entering all items together into a principle component analysis (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The results indicated that neither single factor emerged nor the first factor explained the majority of the variance. Thus, common method variance did not seem to be a problem in our sample data.
4.3 Hypotheses testing
¡@To test the hypotheses in this study, a structural regression model was conducted for our conceptual model. The results in figure 4.1 show that stimuli was significantly and positively related to similarity (£]=.210, P<.01), and overload confusion (£]=.204, P<.01), but not ambiguity confusion (£]=.237, ns). Thus, Hypotheses 1a and 1b were supported, Hypothesis 1c was not supported. 
	Hypotheses 2 predicted that store knowledge would positively impact three aspects of customer confusion. As shown in figure 4.1, store knowledge was only significantly and positively related to similarity confusion (£]=.398, P<.001), but not significantly related to both overload confusion and ambiguity confusion (£]= -.025, ns, and£]= -.039, ns). Thus, Hypotheses 2a was supported, Hypotheses 2b and 2c were not supported.
	The results in figure 4.1 also indicates that similarity confusion was significantly and positively related to decision postponement (£]=.085, P<.01), and inertia (£]=.209, P<.05), thus providing support for Hypotheses 3a and 3b. Moreover, overload confusion was also significantly and positively related to decision postponement (£]=.297, P<.001), and inertia (£]=.212, P<.001), hence Hypotheses 4a and 4b were supported. In addition, ambiguity confusion was only significantly and positively related to inertia (£]=.110, P<.05), but not decision postponement (£]=.134, ns), thus Hypotheses 5a was supported, Hypotheses 5b was not supported.
¡@The mediation effect of consumer confusion was also tested by a structural regression model in our study. Cohen and Cohen (1983) stated that if all path coefficients of independent variable to dependent variable and to mediator, and of mediator to dependent variable are statistically significant at the same level of alpha, then the partial mediation effect can be taken as statistically significant at the same level of alpha too. However, if the direct effect between independent and dependent variables is not statistically significant, then the hypothesis of ¡§pure¡¨ mediation (completely mediation) between two variables is supported (Baron and Kenny, 1986; Kline, 2011; Shrout and Bolger, 2002). According to the results of structural regression model, stimuli was significantly and positively associated with both decision postponement (£]=.337, P<.001), and inertia (£]=.222, P<.001), and store knowledge was also significantly and positively related to both decision postponement (£]=.136, P<.001), and inertia (£]=.361, P<.001).Thus, the direct effects between the independent and dependent variables were statistically significant. Moreover, based on the results in figure 4.1, we found that similarity confusion significantly and partially mediates the relationships between stimuli and decision postponement and inertia, and the relationships between store knowledge and decision postponement and inertia (all path coefficients were statistically significant at the same level of alpha, p<0.01). Thus, Hypotheses 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d were partially supported. Additionally, overload confusion also significantly and partially mediates the relationship between stimuli and decision postponement and inertia (all path coefficients were statistically significant at the same level of alpha, p<0.01), but it does not mediate the relationships between store knowledge and decision postponement and inertia. Thus, Hypotheses 7a and 7b were partially supported, but Hypotheses 7c and 7d were not supported. However, we found no evidence for the mediation effect of ambiguity confusion on the relationships between stimuli and decision postponement and inertia, and the relationships between store knowledge and decision postponement and inertia. Thus, Hypotheses 8a, 8b, 8c, and 8d were not supported.


5. Conclusions and Discussions
¡@Our paper examined the antecedents and consequences of customer confusion in the Taiwan convenience stores context. The research aimed at providing more empirical findings for deeper understanding of customer confusion. Our findings offer several important implications for researchers and practitioners.
¡@The results revealed several interesting findings. Firstly, among the antecedents of consumer confusion, we found that stimuli positively affected similarity confusion and overload confusion, but not ambiguity confusion. This finding indicates that several stimuli factors coming from advertizing and promotion, store environments, and interpersonal communication, do result in customers¡¦ confusion in both of similarity and overload. However these factors do not contribute to customer¡¦s ambiguity confusion. 
¡@Secondly, store knowledge was found to contribute only to similarity confusion. This finding implies that customers feel many products and services of convenience stores are very similar, the reason may be that customers cumulate too much knowledge about brand images, product attributes, advertizing and promotions from convenience store markets. However, store knowledge was not related to overload confusion and ambiguity confusion, indicating customers do not feel their knowledge of convenience stores making them to be unclear about product characteristics, and they do not feel difficult when confront with more product information and alternatives. 
¡@Thirdly, among the consequences of customer confusion, decision postponement was found to be affected by both similarity confusion and overload confusion. However, we found no evidence for the relationship between ambiguity confusion and decision postponement. These findings are consistent with prior literature (Matzler et al. 2011; Walsh et al. 2007) indicating customers¡¦ purchase decision would be delayed if they feel too much similarity between products and services or if they have overload information. Moreover, although customers do feel information overloading and similarity confusion, however they could clarify products and services between different convenience store chains, thus ambiguity confusion have no impact on their decision postponement. In addition, all three aspects of customer confusion were positively associated with inertia. This finding implies the positive contribution of customer confusion to their inertia. Customers would rely more on their inertia to make decision if customers are confused about similarity or could not distinguish between products and services, and obtain too much information of convenience store chains.
¡@Finally, the relationships between the antecedents and consequences of consumer confusion were found to be partially mediated by both similarity and overload confusion. This finding indicates that stimuli and store knowledge result in similarity  confusion and overload confusion, both of which in turn partially lead to more consumers¡¦ decision postponement and inertia. However, the mediation effect of ambiguity confusion was not found in our model, implying stimuli and store knowledge do not have indirect effects on decision postponement and inertia through the consumers¡¦ ambiguity confusion.
