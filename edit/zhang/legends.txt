So many questions? Which one would you like know first? Feel free to choose the lesson by clicking the list on the left side.
"Introduction of  the lecturer:
We would like to give our appreciation to Mr. Ho, Shih-Sung for collecting these interesting stories from the ancient times.
"
 Mr. Ho is currently served as the Associate Professor at Hsin Sheng Junior College of Medical Care and Management. He had edited “Hakka Thesaurus”, “100 Hakka Slangs”, “200 Hakka slangs”, and “Hakka Puzzles.”
If you are the regular visitor of Hakka e-learning center, you must have seen the lesson of “Let’s chat” which is also his work.
 How did human come from?
There is one saying that human was made by God and women were created by one of the ribs from men.
However, China have another saying that human was made by a woman who is known as the famous Goddess Nuwa.
In legend, she has a human head with a snake body. She is very beautiful and light-weighted. She could fly and walk and never get old. Some people said the reason she is never aging is because she has Goddess power.
Moreover, she could change for 70 kinds of looks in a day just like a magician. It is so amazing and it’s even better than Sun-Wu-Kong.
One day, she felt bored and thought there were no people in this world other than her brother Fu Yi. So, she wanted to make more people just like her. She started to take a piece of mud and mold it like a human. Suddenly, the mud began to move.
Ha, she also made a chicken to walk around her. Now she was amused. The next day, she started to make a dog, and the third day a pig. Later on, she made a sheep, a cow, a horse in the following few days.
On the seventh day which was the most important day, she made a human who has a face just look like hers. This day is called “The day of human” which is also the 7th of January.
Have you noticed that dogs and chickens came to earth earlier than human in this story and they were also made by a woman?  The world has started to become lively because of so many people and animals are there.
Human finally was born who was made by Goddess Nuwa with mud. No wonder everyone says that “Mud is the mother of everything.”
Hereafter, we would say “Back to the nature” which means returning to the earth when people passed away. We would also say “To be immense as the East Sea” which is also related to mud. It is truly amazing!
You must imagine Nuwa would make other things in the next few days. However, she felt tired after making human, so she stopped.  
So this important “Day of Human” became the day that human was born. Therefore, every year in the 7th of January, people would treat it as a new beginning. For example, there are 7 days in a week, Christian will go to church every Sunday, and Buddhist will do the 7 days ceremony after people die. There is always a 7 in every cycle. You see, different culture has their common point together as well.
 In addition, January 7th is the day when Niou-Lang and Chih-Niu meet. This 7 means vitality here. Moreover, on the day of January 7th, people used to eat the 7 particular dishes for more intelligence. Ha, it is cute that the number of “7” represents so many things at one.
Of course, Goddess Nuwa was not feeling bored anymore after she made chickens, dogs, pigs and human and the world became vividly. They respect and love each other. For this reason, there are more and more creatures were born.   
Isn’t this an fascinating story? Next time when someone asks you how did human come from? Hope you could remember this story and tell them the story of Goddess Nuwa.
 Do you still remember Goddess Nuwa? She was busy making people and fixing the sky later. Do you know why?
 Back then…Because there were too many people, they became complicated and fought with each other for wanting to be the king. 
 The famous Gung Kung Shih (Kang-Huei) and Juan-Shiu were fighting to be a king.
 Gung Kung Shih used his horn to stab Bujou Mountain and made the sky column broken. And he also lacerated the sky and cause some unknown objects continuing to fall which also resulted in serious thunderstorm and killing so many people.
 It was also because he stepped on the ground too hard making the groundwater flooded. Many people died because of it. 
 Goddess Nuwa saw this tragedy and felt very sad.
 So she started to fix the sky with the five-color stone. Finally, the sky was all fixed up, and the flood was stopped too. The beautiful weather was back and saved numerous lives.
 People were so grateful for her help. In order to worship her, they would prepare tributes to remember this “sky fixing day.” You can still see this custom today! Even for Hakka people who constantly migrate, they still remember to follow this tradition until now.
 Goddess Nuwa is known as Jiou Tian Shiuan Niu. Most of the Hakka temples still worship her and there are still many temples majorly worship this Goddess such as Bu Tian Temple in Ilan.
 It is such a pity that some of these temples can hardly hear Hakka language anymore because of “the number of Hakka people are less than Taiwanese.” Hakka people are gradually integrated by Taiwanese and they rarely speck Hakka anymore. This is like pestilence slowly damaging the Hakka. Hakka will be soon to lose their tradition, if they do not have conscious toward this issue.
 Back to the story, the day when Nuwa fixed the sky was January 20th which is called sky fixed day as well.
 At the morning of sky fixung day, every household will prepare sweet rice cake which is also called the New Year Cake for worship the God. The sweet rice cake will be made in a flat shape in case they need to help fix the sky, so it is also known as “Sky fixer.”
 After worshiping, people will have a day off to have fun. On this day off, men will not plow the field because they are afraid to cause the flood. Women will stop spinning to avoid breaking the sky again. They all understand the sacrifice for knowing that if anything ruins the beautiful weather; all the work would be wasted. 
 Hence, as the proverb says: “if the sky breaks again, we will all be death” and “if the sky breaks again, we will be in deep trouble.” So why not have a day off and have some fun instead?  This is the best Hakka Women's Day and also the earliest weekend break system.
 This custom for making sweet rice cake to help Goddess Nuwa is one kind of worship toward women. This is a very cutting age idea of sexual equality and respecting women. You can clearly see Hakka’s straight forward attitude and their insistence on traditional culture from here.
Moreover, on sky fixing day, there are several places holding singing competition especially in Zhudong Township, Hsinchu County. They have been held this competition for over 40 years. Singers are coming from everywhere with the youngest participant of 4 years old and the oldest participant of 90 years old. Why not take a visit there next time during sky fixing day?
 “The sky is easy to break, so we have to focus on our work.  It does not matter whether we can make money or not, because we love to talk about the sky breaking story.” “Done it or not, we chat until the sky breaks. Make money or not, we love to talk about the sky breaking story.”
 This is the long lasting story of Nuwa fixing the sky. Does your family still have this special tradition?
 Do you see these two chickens? Do you understand what are they talking?
 It was said that the chickens Nuwa made were totally different from the ones we see now. They are very beautiful creatures with two horns on their head. It was so beautiful you couldn’t stop looking at them.
 At that time, dragons lived on the ground with human. One day, a dragon tried to fly but he couldn’t make it because he did not have horn.  So guess what did the dragon do?
 That’s right. The dragon wanted to borrow the two beautiful horns from chickens.
 He is very smart, because he knew chicken and centipede are good friend. In order to get trust from chicken, he asked centipede to be his guarantor. Of course, centipede agreed to help and went talking to chicken.
 Centipede said: “The dragon wants to fly, so can you lend your horns to him?”
 The loyalty chicken also said yes without consideration. But he asked: “What if the dragon does not come back?”
 In order to calm the chicken down, the centipede said ”Don’t worry, you only need to shout to the sky “Give my horns back” three times before dawn, the dragon will give them back to you.” 
 But the thing worried the chicken the most was still happened. The dragon disappeared.
 So the chicken went to centipede but he was still saying the same thing: you just shout to the sky for three times, I believe the dragon will come back soon.
The chicken did the same thing every morning “Give my horns back! Give my horns back!” but the dragon still not came back.
 In the end, the chicken found out he was fooled and felt angry. Hereafter, he told his children that centipede lied to me, so remember to bite him every time when you see him. 
 Of course, the chicken is still fighting for his horns and continuing to shout to the sky “Give my horns back! Give my horns back!” And his wife also shouts together for “Horn, horn, horn” until now.
So now you know what are they talking (Guo Guo Guo) right now? Haha…That’s right, they are talking Hakka. 
During dinner time or Chinese New Year, kids are looking forward to many delicious dishes and drooling beside the stove. Do you know why our grandma or mother will tell us not to stick chopsticks on the stove or table?  
 Oh…it is because they believed sticking chopsticks on the table or stove will lose all the good fortune. But why? Let me tell you another story.
 There was a man called Lo, Yin. He was told that he is destined to be the king someday in the future.
 His mother heard the prediction and became very arrogant about his son.
 Every time when she cooks in the kitchen, she would take the chopsticks to stick on the stove and said: “My son will be the king someday, and I would ask him to kill a man for me.” “My son will be the king someday, and I would ask him to put a man in prison for me.” “My son will be the king someday, and I would ask him to….” She always imagined killing or torturing someone if her son is king in the future.
 Every time when she finished talking, she would heavily stick her chopsticks on the stove. One time, she accidentally stabbed on the God of Stove’s feet.
 The God was hurt and yelled “Who disturbs me?” After he listened carefully, he knew it was the future king’s mother. And he noticed that his mother wanted to only kill or torture people.
 No way, he couldn’t let this person’s son be the king, so he had to cancel his fate for it.
 Hence, he contacted the Emperor of God and told him the entire story. Finally, the Emperor agreed.
 The Emperor of God sent many solders and generals to earth for canceling Lo, Yin’s qualification.
 But they took too much time to get there and it was near dawn.
 The time was almost out there, so they had to leave. In the legend, Gods need to leave before dawn because they don’t want people to see them. Although, they couldn’t finish all the work, but they had successfully canceled his qualification for king.
 Of course, Lo, Yin failed to be the king. I think you should know the reason now. That’s right. It was because of his mother. So the slang of “Lo Yin Jie A Mu” means talking nonsense. And the reason why can’t we stick chopsticks on the stove was coming from this story too. 
 So, never stick your chopsticks on the stoves, it would probably cost your good fortune. For sure, do not stick your pen on the table; it would probably cost your luck too.  So the slang of “Lo Yin Jie A Mu” means talking nonsense.
It has become most people’s habit to be one-day vegetarian during January 1st and 15th. But do you know why?
 There is one slang in Hakka saying that:“I was been treated worse than a dog, so I would rather be a monk than your father.”Can you understand that? This is actually a kind of sarcasm to treat the bitterness as a delicacy.
 This slang is coming from a father he thinks he was treated like a dog for not being invited to the celebrations on New Year's Eve.
 Been treated like a dog. He was sad and decided to
become a monk and contribute himself to Buddha. His decision left all his children lots of regrets. You must want to know why he would be like this and make this decision.
 become a monk and contribute himself to Buddha. His decision left all his children lots of regrets. You must want to know why he would be like this and make this decision.
 There was a family with five brothers and they lived separately. But their father lived alone. According to the custom, children should invite their parents to dinner on the New Year’s Eve.
 However, the eldest brother was busy and he thought the second brother would invite their father. But the second brother thought the third brother would invite their father and so did the forth brother and the youngest one. Therefore, nobody invited their father for family dinner on that night.
The father was left alone and said: I am alone at my old house. I was looking forward to have dinner with my families but no one is coming. Facing with cold meal and lonely air, the sound of insects, and fire firecracker across the street, I wait and wait but no one is coming.”
Until the evening, he saw his grandsons running to his room and he thought they were coming to invite him to the family dinner. But they just played around and still no one was asking. 
 He felt weird and asked: “Son, have you eaten yet?”
 All the children said together: “Of course, we have eaten and even our dog was full too.”
He was shocked and felt really sorry. The presents that he was going to give to them were slide from his hands because of disappointment.
He closed the door after they left and went to bed directly, but he couldn’t fall asleep at all.  
After few hours thinking, he saw a temple standing in front of his house and heard bells clearly.  Finally, he made the decision to leave his family and become a monk.
On the next day’s morning, his children suddenly thought about their father and went to visit him. However, he already left. They couldn’t find him and didn’t know where he was going.
 In the last, they saw a note on the table and said: “I was been treated worse than a dog, so I would rather be a monk than your father.” And also: “Now I believe the slang says that the poorest people are those who have the most money.  And the poorest man is the one who have so many children but still get hungry.” All the children felt terribly regret and sorry after seeing this note.
After few day's looking, they still couldn’t find their father. In order to repent, they decided not to eat any meat on January 1 every year from now on. Because of the influence of this story, people start to follow the tradition as well.
Chinese emphasize very much on family value especially during Chinese New Year. New Year’s Eve is even more important for it is the day that family can get together and have a lovely meal. Children will receive some red envelopes with money inside and play with firecrackers. Young people should pay visit to their parents and the elderly can have some family time giving everybody chance to bond with their families.   
However, everything is not always the way to be. When some families are having fun during the New Year’s Eve, some are just by themselves and feel lonely.  
 I think you must haven’t thought of the red butt of monkey is related to a discord relationship between a mother-in-law and a wife, right? But why? Let me tell you this story.
 Once upon a time, there was a mother-in-law who hated his son’s wife very much. She always gave her cold shoulder and deliberately told her to do lots of housework. She would ask her to pick up some firewood or fetch water from a faraway distance.
On day, the wife was going to fetch water in a well. She felt so sad about herself, so she started to cry on the way to the well.  
 When she put down the bucket, an old man walked to her. 
 "“Why do you cry, lady?” The old man asked.
 “Because I am ugly so my mother-in-law hates me and she always says bad things to me.  I felt so upset so I cry.” The wife answered with tears. 
 "
  The old man gave her two flowers after hearing the story.
  He did some gestures and spat on her face. Suddenly, she turned into a very beautiful woman. She looked at herself from the reflection of the water and felt so happy. But, when she tried to say thanks to the old man, he had already gone.
  The wife came home gladly. Her mother-in-law was surprised and asked: “How do you become so beautiful?” So the wife told her everything.
  So the wife told her everything.
  Her mother-in-law wanted to be beautiful like her as well, so she took a bucket, rushed to the well and faked the crying. She hoped she could meet the old man as well.
  As expected, the old man was there by the well.
  The old man asked her “Why do you cry, madam?” The mother-in-law told the same story as her son’s wife and continued crying.
  The old man also took two flowers and did some gestures. Now, what do you think she would like? Suddenly she became a monkey.
  From that day, she was afraid to come home and became a homeless. Until she felt hungry, she would sneak back home and steal the food on the stove.
  The wife didn’t know what to do with it, so she asked the old man again. He taught her to put a burning brick on the stove. If she returned again and accidently sat on the brick, she would stop steal the food.
  As she expected, the mother-in-law was back again.
 She saw the food on the stove and jumped on it. All of the sudden, she sat on the burning brick because she thought it was a stool. She screamed and her butt became red. Finally she ran away.    
 From now on, the red-butt monkey never went home again. Now you must realize the reason why monkeys get red butts now!
