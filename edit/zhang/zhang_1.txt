 Hello everyone, welcome to our class, “Learning Hakka idioms from stories!” I am Grandpa Hakka. It is very nice to meet you all.
 Um…talking about Hakka sayings, there are actually many kinds of them. Hakka people love to observe things, and they prefer to describe them with metaphors.
 If you ask me how many proverbs there are in Hakka, I probably have to take three days and still couldn’t finish …
 They are classified into the categories of life,  meteorology, industry, folk , legends, life philosophy, and etc. There are too many of them…
 For example, there is one saying like this “Eat less you could feel the aroma, eat too much would lose its taste.”
 This sentence is the advice that the Hakka elderly give not to eat too much! You would rather eat less than too much…It would burden your stomach and it is bad for your health also. If you eat too much, it would make the food tasteless…
 Only from this short sentence, you can read the profound implications. No wonder people say that there is lots of life philosophy behind Hakka slang.
These idioms were originally developed from the living experiences of our ancestors, and simultaneously represented the traditional Hakka life focused on agriculture.
They have strong literary characteristics and are generalized with vivid and concrete language. If you know how to appreciate them, you would experience different feelings from regular literature.
 Hakka expressions do not come out of nowhere but from Hakka folk stories which possibly are real stories or maybe fiction.
 However, most of the classic ones have the following features:
 "Folk 
 Universal
 Profound
 Oral
 Collective
 Inherited
 Variable
 "
 Because of these features, Hakka slang has been passed down from generation to generation.
  Today, we will try to learn these expressions through profound and interesting Hakka stories which I believe would definitely impress you! So, let’s get started!

  Long time ago, there was a servant working for a squire. Everything was good until one day he saw a dead cat in the field.
 He saw instantly that this cat belonged to the squire. Therefore, he quickly reported  to him.
 The squire was very angry and thought the servant was the one who harmed the cat. 
 Do you think I wouldn’t know that it was you who killed my cat?
  In fact, the squire secretly had feelings for the servant’s wife, and he was trying to make her his wife! So he thought this was a perfect chance to blame the servant!
 Servant: I did not kill the cat…really...
 Squire: I don’t care; you need to think of a way to compensate me.
  Servant: So…how much was this cat? I could give you the money…
 Squire: My cat is very smart and he is not a regular cat. “When he called out under the roof, all the rats would rush out. When he called out upon the roof, all the rats would hide in the vases.” Last year, there was one guy who offered me thirty-three hundred for the cat but I was not willing to sell it.
 Thirty-three hundred seems not much now but it was a large amount of money back then. How could the servant afford it? When the servant looked distressed, the squire said…
 Squire: if you can’t afford this money, I could take your wife for it!
  The servant was very upset and went home to talk with his wife. His wife told him not to worry after she heard the story. She said, Just tell the squire he will get the money in two days. I know how to handle this!
  After two days…
  The squire came to the servant’s house and felt glad that his plan was finally to be realized and that he could get the servant's wife. But the servant was not home when he arrived.
 Servant’s wife:  I am sorry; he was one hundred short of thirty-three hundred so he went out to borrow the money. Please wait for a moment.
 But he waited until noon and felt lost. Meanwhile, he started to feel hungry. At this moment, the servant’s wife took out some dishes.
 Servant’s wife:  You must be hungry; here are some things for you to eat first. You could have some rice if you want.
 When the squire tried to put some rice in his bowl, he accidentally broke the spoon.
  Squire: I think I broke the spoon, what should I do?
  The servant’s wife said…
 "Servant’s wife:  This spoon was not a regular one.  “This spoon could cook rice and make gruel; also it could cook fish and meat.”
 Last year, there was one guy offered me sixty-six thousand for it, and I was not willing to sell, so you must pay me the same money for it…
 "
 Squire: It is nonsense for a spoon to cost that much money.
 Servant’s wife:  It makes perfect sense! If you could have a cat worth thirty-three hundred, of course I could have a spoon worth sixty-six thousand!

 Boss Huang Man was a legendary character who first reclaimed farmland in the Miaoli Uchiyama area. Every time when people talked about “Boss Huang Man”, they would praise his wisdom and achievements.
  It was also his personality which helped him develop many good friends. He cultivated much virgin soil and became rich, starting from nothing. He was one of the tycoons of the late Qing Dynasty in Taiwan.
  There were lots of legendary stories about his cultivation of virgin soil in Uchiyama. Because he tried to take over the land from aboriginal people, these people didn’t like him.
 There was one time Boss Huang Man asked his servants to harvest half-matured bananas. The servants were very confused…
 Bananas needed to wait until they were 70% to 80% matured before being harvested. So why the rush to harvest these half-matured bananas?
 ""Just follow my orders to cut them down and simmer them in a pot,"" Boss Huang Man said.
 "
 So they did…
 After a few days, he asked the servants to cut off a piece of bamboo.
 Boss Huang Man: Now you can put that simmered banana skin into the bamboo and squeeze it.
 Ok, you can pour it out now!
 Servants: It looks like poop!
 Boss Huang Man smiles…
 Now we only need a big sandal!
 When everything was ready around evening, Boss Huang Man brought his servants and threw the poop-like banana skin and sandal on the roads along which the aboriginal people usually passed.
 After pouring the smashed bananas and leaving some foot prints, they left quietly.
 The smashed bananas looked even more like feces after a while!
 At this time, two aboriginal men walked along the road and saw the poop-like banana skin and the big foot print.
 They wondered if there were a giant among the Han people. Otherwise, how could they have such a big stool and such large footprints?!
 They became so scared they fled to their village telling their own people what they saw. Hence, the aboriginal people decided to retreat to the mountain.
 “O Sii Hak Fan”
 Boss Huang Man used simple things like bananas and a sandal to win the perfect war!  Because of his wisdom, he actually saved lots of human lives.
 People nowadays use O Sii Hak Fan to describe a bluff which uses extravagant and exaggerated effects to terrify people.
 Normally you could make a sentence such as, Why are you yelling like this? If people didn’t know what happened they would think you are O Sii Hak Fan (bluffing). 
 Isn't this story more imaginative than regular slang? Hakka literature is really interesting!

 One day, Liu, Don-Bin traveled to a wine store and drank three urns of wine. As he enjoyed his wine…
 Store owner: Sorry, wine is all sold out!
 I just started to enjoy myself, how come all the wine is sold out?
 Sorry, we are running a small business, so we don’t have extra money to store more. Please try the dishes first, I will go look for some more wine for you.
 Liu, Don-Bin waved his hands and led the store owner to the well in the yard.
 As they stood on the different sides of the well, the store owner felt confused and watched Liu, Don-Bin.
 Liu, Don-Bin looked at the well and muttered toward it.
 And he said to the store owner…
 All the water in this well has now become wine. You can fetch the water for me now!
 The store owner tried it and was surprised that the water in the well was really wine! 
 So Liu, Don-Bin had a good time that day. The store owner was even happier because his water well had become a wine well, and he started to make lots of money with it.
 After one year…
 Liu, Don-Bin passed by the store again and was greeted by the store owner happily. He asked whether Liu, Don-Bin needed anything else.
 I really appreciate that you gave me that wine well before. But it would be even better if you could give me some wine lees to feed my pigs!
 Liu, Don-Bin started to laugh, and led the store owner to the same well and muttered again.
 The hearts of people are too greedy. It is not even enough to have free wine!
 So he pointed at the well and the wine turned back to water again.
 The hearts of people are too greedy. It is not even enough to have free wine!
 This sentence describes the greed within the human heart. People like the store owner who only want to get everything without working end up with nothing!
 Greedy people usually don’t have real happiness.
 When you live in a damaged temple, you would only wish to live in a cottage. When you have a cottage, you would wish to have a cabin. When you have a cabin, you would want to live in a high-rise building. When you live in the building, you want a palace. When you move to a palace, you would wish you are the king. When you are king, you want to be god…So it goes on and on, this endless greed!

   1. Appreciate the allusion of “Gou Jin Suo, Shr Wu Tuei”
   2. Understand the meaning and application of “Gou Jin Suo, Shr Wu Tuei”
   "
 Long time ago, there was a rich man and all his daughters were married. 
 Of them, the youngest daughter was married to an honest and straightforward man.
 One time, the families got together for the rich man’s birthday.
 This youngest daughter was worried that her husband couldn’t stop himself from eating too much chicken because they were too poor to have chicken at home. So she made an agreement with her husband. 
 I will tie a rope on your feet, if I think you can have the chicken, I will pull the rope, which will mean you can eat now.
 Everything went well at the beginning. Although the table was full of all kinds of delicious food, the husband behaved himself and didn’t have anything without his wife’s approval.
 After a while, everyone started to throw chicken bones under the table.
 At this moment, two dogs rushed in from outside and tried to eat the bones.
 Suddenly, one dog accidentally tripped over the rope twice. And another dog snagged it a third time. So the husband thought his wife wanted him to eat chicken and he took all the chicken in his bowl.
 The last time, he couldn’t stand it and he said to his wife…
 You sure you want me to eat all these?
 “Gou Jin Suo, Shr Wu Tuei”
 “Jin Suo” means tripping the (signal) rope.  “Wu Tuei” means not being able to finish all the food.
 This proverb has the meaning of endless.
 For example, next week is your uncle’s birthday, ????
 It means that there are too many celebrations coming up, just like the dogs couldn’t stop tripping the eating signal.

 "After this lesson, you will be able to:
 1. Appreciate the origin of “The four sentences”
 2. Understand the expression, “The four sentences during a Hakka celebration or funeral ”
 "
 The four sentences represent not only a deep knowledge, but are also a traditional literary genre in Hakka.
 The four sentences are commonly spoken during Hakka celebrations or funerals for the purpose of congratulation or condolences. Although they are rarely used now, many villages still follow this important tradition.
 The four sentences are similar to four words quatrains. Sometimes, they are created instantly, but sometimes they take the old wisdom in the past.
 You can say them in many different occasions. For example, they would work well when you want to say them sometime during house moving, a wedding or a birthday party. 
 The four sentences do not have specific rules as to who should say them, although people will invite a host or people who are familiar with the rules to say them now.
 For experienced family members, they would say them when the new couple is giving a toast to express their blessing.
 They are not just read following the words but with a certain rhythm. People standing around should follow the rhythm and read them together to perform the perfect four sentences.
 Presenters also need to be very familiar with the Hakka language and its rhythms for handling the concepts well. Nowadays, young folks have already lost this ability. 
 Relatively speaking, the “words” are not so important in the four sentences. The intention to preserve the Hakka language is not only to practice the speaking, but also to “sing” out its meaning. It is better to treat Hakka as one kind of music.
 The content of the four sentences not only represents a blessing, the humor inside the words also has the effect of warming up the place.
 Do not feel “The four sentences” are outdated and only for the elderly to say. If you could understand their meaning, you would learn something interesting as well.
 Next, we are going to introduce some examples for you to say on appropriate occasions.
 There are many traditional four sentences. Correctly using these words in the right situation is the most important thing!
 "There are some simple ones for the following situations including:
 A birthday party, lighting birthday candles, wedding, wedding toast, visiting the bride, etc.
