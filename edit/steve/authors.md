# Steve Hoover

Steve has been in 台灣 for how many years.

# Greg Matheson

Greg has been in 台灣 for 14 years. He likes the weather and the tropical fruit, but he doesn't like the motorcycles and the mosquitos. He loves teaching. Like Steve, he's been called a demanding teacher. He thinks learning languages (he knows Japanese, and some Korean and Chinese) is a transformative experience. He has a strong sense of self-efficacy, but he feels ineffective as a teacher. It's a challenge to get the students to do what he wants.
