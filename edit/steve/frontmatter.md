# Preface

Writing distinguishes the educated person from the uneducated person. Your writing in English is more important for native speakers when they form an impression of your intelligence than what you say.

When you put words on paper, you are creating a thing, just as much as you are when building a house, or cooking food. It doesn't have a shape or form, like a house, or food. But is is real, just like a computer app is real, and it can change other people's lives.
