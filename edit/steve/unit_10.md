# Action Research

A.  Some things we do, it is difficult to see the effect of. For example, brushing your teeth.

What is the effect of your brushing your teeth this morning? Was it good or not good? You can't see your teeth without a mirror. Even then, it is difficult to see your teeth, because they are hidden inside your mouth.

We brush our teeth, not because of any effect we notice, but because we're supposed to brush them. Everyone brushes them. We think it is a good idea to brush them.

B.  Other things we do, we do by chance and we see a good result. For example, pieces of bread in fruit salad.

Hey, pieces of bread in fruit salad tastes great. Like cake. The texture of bread suits the sweet fruit salad. Try it, you'll like it.

You didn't have any idea of creating a new recipe. Someone suggested it, or you had an extra slice of dry bread and you just tore it up and put it in some fruit salad you were eating. You weren't trying out a new recipe.

C. Okay. A lot of our actions are like that. We do things:

	A.  because we are supposed to, or everyone does it, or it is a rule, and we don't real know what the result is. Studying at school is like that. Or,
	B.  for no reason at all, by chance, unthinkingly. Or,
	C.  we do things because we want to see what the effect is.

All these 3 ways of doing things are good ways to do things, but A. and B. are difficult to talk about. Let's talk and write about C.

This last way of doing things, with an idea about what we want to do, and where we expect an effect, can be called Action Research. In this unit, let's,

	3. think of something risky, where we are not too sure if there is going to be an effect or not, or if the effect is going to be good or not, 
	4. do it
	5. think about the effect
	6. write it up:
		
		i. the idea
		ii. what we did
		iii. what was the effect
		iv. what did we learn
