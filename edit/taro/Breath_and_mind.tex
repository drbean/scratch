To master the secret of shakuhachi music, your breath has to be soft and slow.
The Chinese-character word meaning “breath” consists of two different characters.
One means breath and the other one means mind.
Your breath goes fast ,when you feel sad ,angry ,or are feeling uneasy.
Your breath is not something you have tried to obtain, but was given by the Creator.
All you have to do is to let it flow freely, with no struggling or pushing.
You are not the one who controls your breath; this means that you are under the control of your breath.
