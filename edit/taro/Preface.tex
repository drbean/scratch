Preface

This text is written as an elementary guide to the shakuhachi, the Japanese 
bamboo flute. 
Although the shakuhachi can be played by anybody who can breathe, it takes a long time to produce a sound which pleases your soul.
To someone who would like to start learning shakuhachi music, I would suggest
listening to many performers, and to be choosy about finding your teacher.
In this way, one can avoid the waste of time. A sword without an edge is
useless.
If you study under the proper teacher, the shakuhachi will be your friend for
life. 
I hope you experience this mystical instrument.
