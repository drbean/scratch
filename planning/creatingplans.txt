It's important to have clear goals. Running a business is like taking a trip. Just remember that if you don't know where you want to go, and you go ahead without a plan, it's your fault when you are unhappy about what happens to the business. Choose a structure carefully for your business based on that plan. That structure will determine how the business is run.

Planning is very, very important. Before talking to people who want to use your service or product, you need to do a lot of planning. But it is also very important to talk to clients. You need to see if you have what they are looking for. If you don't have what they want, perhaps your business plans won't be successful.
