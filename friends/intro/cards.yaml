        \item [Reasons for actions] Chandler doesn't use the gym very much and it is expensive. But he finds it very hard to quit. So he needs Ross to help him. They are both afraid he will not be able to quit.
        \item [Result] Chandler is angry and upset that his friend is not able to resist Maria. He walks quickly out of the office and takes Ross's hand and pulls him out of the gym. He refuses to talk to the receptionist and Dave when they try to stop him.
        \item [Conclusion] Chandler looked weaker than Ross, but in the end we see he is stronger. However he is still also a member of the gym.

        \item [Reasons for actions] The gym wants the money, so it makes it hard to quit. It puts pressure on people to continue their membership.
        \item [Actions] It tries to convince Chandler to continue by telling him about a Swedish spa. It prevents Ross from going with Chandler to talk with Dave. Dave asks Chandler if he is satisfied with his body. These actions appear to be unsuccessful. But Maria, who is wearing only a swimsuit, is able to get Ross on to an exercise cycle.
        \item [Result] The trick with Maria fails to get Ross to join the gym.
