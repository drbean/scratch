    Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Now remember what we talked about. You've got to be strong.
    Chandler: Yes, yes.
    Ross: Now one more time. 'Hey. Don't you want a washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs?'
    Chandler: No. I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts.
    Ross: Good. That's good.
    Chandler: Okay.

    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: You want to quit?
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: You do realize you won't have access to our new full-service Swedish spa?
    Ross: Oomph.
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: Okay. Dave in the membership office handles quitters.

    Receptionist: Excuse me. Are you a member?
    Ross: Me? No.
    Receptionist: Sorry. Members only.
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Ross: Okay, man. Be strong. Oomph.

    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Dave: Now can you honestly tell me that you're a hundred percent satisfied with your body?
    Chandler: Yes, yes. Most of the time. I mean, sure, I have my bad days. But then I remember what a cute smile I have.
    Dave: No. We were voted best-equipped gym in New York two years running. Do you really want to give that up.
    Chandler: Yes. I hate it here. Everything that you have in here is very heavy.
    Dave: (Telephone rings) Yeah. Really? Okay. You don't want to make your friend work out alone do you?
    Chandler: What friend?
    Dave: Your friend Ross. Just joined.

    Ross: What?
    Phoebe: Your thing, you know. You're the guy who gets divorced.
    Chandler, Joey: Hey. (nods)
    Ross: It's not my thing. I do not love getting divorced.
    Phoebe: Yes, you do. This is your third divorce. You love divorce so much, you're probably going to marry it. And then, ...
    Chandler, Joey: (Look at each other)
    Phoebe: Then it won't work out. So you're going to have to divorce it. The divorcing guy. Ha! Ha! I'm so drunk.

    Ross: Hey, guys. What's up?
    Chandler: You know. Oh, my god.
    Monica: What happened to your teeth?
    Ross: I whitened them.
    Chandler: Really?
    Ross: Well, what do you think?
    Monica: Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
    Ross: Come on. Seriously.
    Monica: They're really, really, really white.
    Chandler: Yeh. What was wrong with your old .. human teeth?
    Ross: I did leave the gel on for a little longer than it said to.
    Monica: How much longer.
    Ross: A day.
    Monica: Ross, you know that tonight is your date with Hilary.
    Ross: I know. That's why I did it. Come on. Are they really that bad?
    Chandler: No, no. You'll be fine. (to Monica) Hilary's blind, right?

    Phoebe: Always.
    Ross: I didn't get the annulment.
    Phoebe: What?
    Ross: We're still married. Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

    Hilary: Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little.
    Ross: How about all the way? Cool poster. Or should I say, "groovy" poster. So, where were we?
    Hilary: Are those your teeth?
    Ross: Oh, you can see them, uh?
    Hilary: Yes. They're insanely white.

    Chandler: (Looks at himself) What gave me away?
    Monica: I've just got to tell her. I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe. And she's the only one left.
    Chandler: Okay, that's it. So everybody knows. It's official. We're moving in together. No turning back. Are you scared? Are you?
    Monica: No.
    Chandler: Well, that was my scariest voice. You're very brave.

    Ross: Because I am not in that place.
    Phoebe: Okay, I didn't understand that. But, you know, maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.

    Chandler: Okay. I am officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me, Matt, Joe.
    Joey: (In box) Hee-hee-hee.
    Chandler: (Looks at box) Well, I guess Joey went home. And look. There's still one box that I had to unpack.
    Joey: Well, I got you.
    Chandler: Oh, my god. You almost gave me a heart attack.
    Joey: But it was so hard not to laugh. I tell you that.

    Chandler: You know, how's that going now? Are you okay with the not flirting thing. 
    Joey: Ah, yeh. But, so far. But it's tough, you know. I've got all this built-up flirting energy.

    Monica: What?
    Ross: What?
    Chandler: I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
    Ross: Why does anyone have to be naked?
    Monica: Why is Ross naked?
    Ross: I had to show Chandler something.
    Chandler: What?
    Monica: Naked?
    Ross: Yeh, I, I, I guess I have a .. a guy problem.
    Monica: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
    Chandler: Look. Just come back later. We'll get everything squared away. And you can come back later.
    Monica: Hey, listen. There's still some of Chandler's medicine left underneath the sink in the bathroom. Bye.
    Chandler: Bye.

    Janine: Hey, Joey. Got some beer for you.
    Joey: Don't you mean, "for whom?"
    Janine: Listen. I was going to order some pizza. Want to share one?
    Joey: Pizza. Huh. It's not like I've never had that before.

    Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
    Monica: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
    Ross: Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
    Monica: Well, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from Texas.

    Ross: That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.

Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again, huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?

And instead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now, here we are, with our future before us, and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
