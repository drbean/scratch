    Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Now remember what we talked about. You've got to be strong.
    Chandler: Yes, yes.
    Ross: Now one more time. 'Hey. Don't you want a washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs?'
    Chandler: No. I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts.
    Ross: Good. That's good.
    Chandler: Okay.
    
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: You want to quit?
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: You do realize you won't have access to our new full-service Swedish spa?
    Ross: Oomph.
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Receptionist: Okay. Dave in the membership office handles quitters.
    
    Receptionist: Excuse me. Are you a member?
    Ross: Me? No.
    Receptionist: Sorry. Members only.
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Ross: Okay, man. Be strong. Oomph.
    Chandler: Oomph.
    
    Receptionist: So, are you a member of any gym?

    Ross: No, and I'm not going to be. So you can save your little speech.
    Receptionist: Okay. No problem. Could you come here for a second?
    Maria: Hi, I'm Maria.
    Ross: Hemm.
    
    Chandler: I want to quit the gym.
    Dave: Now can you honestly tell me that you're a hundred percent satisfied with your body?
    Chandler: Yes, yes. Most of the time. I mean, sure, I have my bad days. But then I remember what a cute smile I have.
    Dave: No. We were voted best-equipped gym in New York two years running. Do you really want to give that up.
    Chandler: Yes. I hate it here. Everything that you have in here is very heavy.
    Dave: (Telephone rings) Yeah. Really? Okay. You don't want to make your friend work out alone do you?
    Chandler: What friend?
    Dave: Your friend Ross. Just joined.
